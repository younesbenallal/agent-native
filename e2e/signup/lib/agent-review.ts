const RUBRIC = `You are reviewing screenshots of a real signup attempt on a deployed web app,
captured in order as one user walked the whole flow with a brand-new email address.

Report only problems a real new user would actually hit. The failures that motivated this
review, so you know the shape of what matters:
- a step that silently does nothing, so the user has to reload the page to continue
- landing back on a signed-out sign-in page after clicking the emailed link
- being signed in to a DIFFERENT app than the one the user signed up for
- an indefinite loading or skeleton state that never resolves
- signed-in state that does not render (no account control, empty shell) even though a session exists
- an error, stack trace, raw JSON, or untranslated/placeholder copy shown to the user

The first-run onboarding welcome screen is expected for a brand-new account. Do NOT report it
just because it has no app shell, account control, or navigation yet; only report onboarding
when a visible action was attempted and the screen demonstrably fails to advance.
The harness clicks through that expected onboarding after the initial post-link capture, so
use the later "after completing first-run onboarding" capture to judge whether the app opened.

The post-link and post-reload captures wait up to 15 seconds for readable content. Treat a
loader that is still present in both captures as a real stall; do not call a single brief
bootstrap loader indefinite when the later capture shows the app or onboarding.

Do NOT report: aesthetic preferences, minor copy wording, anything you cannot see evidence
for in the screenshot or text, or the presence of the test email address itself.

Respond with ONLY a JSON object, no prose or markdown fence, shaped:
{"summary":"one sentence","findings":[{"severity":"high|medium|low","step":"<step label>","issue":"what is wrong","evidence":"what in the screenshot or text shows it"}]}
An empty findings array means the flow looked correct.`;
