# Concurrent Agents

Steve runs many Claude Code and Codex sessions against this one checkout on
purpose, often on the same branch or file. Default assumption on every task:
the working tree is shared branch state. Read existing changes before editing
them, and never reset, clean, stash, or overwrite local work without explicit
authorization.

## Read before you edit

Before touching a file that already has uncommitted changes, re-read it and
build your edit on top of what's there. Landing your own complete fix over a
peer's in-progress one has happened repeatedly — "another agent landed its own
complete fix for the exact same bug in the exact same file, overwriting my
in-progress edits on disk." There is no conflict, no warning; the edit vanishes.

## Diagnosing "did someone revert my work" — correctly

`git diff --stat` line counts are not evidence of a revert — a refactor can
show the same magnitude of deletions. An agent once announced a revert from
stat counts alone and was wrong; it cost a full investigation to disprove.
Before you say "reverted" out loud, run:

```bash
git log --oneline <base>..HEAD    # what actually landed, in order
git diff <base>..HEAD -- <path>   # the real hunks for the files in question
```

Read the hunks: a revert removes logic and puts nothing equivalent back; a
refactor removes the same lines and adds different code doing the same job.
Only the hunks tell you which happened — never `--stat` alone.

## Shallow or grafted worktrees

Shallow clones and grafted worktrees do not have complete ancestry. Treat
`git log -S` and `git merge-base --is-ancestor` results at their boundary as
inconclusive; fetch complete history or verify the date through the remote
commit or pull-request record before calling a change the first occurrence.

## Branch operations follow checkout ownership

In a dedicated task-owned worktree, create or switch to an available branch
needed for the task without asking permission. Git worktrees isolate files; the
Git refs are shared, so never move, rewrite, or delete a branch checked out in
another worktree. If a branch name is already used, choose another available
name. Preserve and carry or reapply local changes; do not stash or discard them.

Before creating or switching branches, record `git status --short
--untracked-files=all` and classify every staged, unstaged, and untracked path.
A switch carries the whole index and worktree, so proceed only when every dirty
path belongs to this task. If any path is unrelated or incomplete, keep the
checkout in place and report the exact paths without asking again.

In a shared checkout, ask before changing branches unless the user gave the
exact operation. Keep platform-assigned Builder.io and Fusion branches in
place.

## Timing the next branch

Before creating a branch, inspect the active worktrees and dirty paths:

```bash
git status --short
git worktree list --porcelain
gh pr list --head "$(git branch --show-current)" --state open
```

In a task-owned worktree, do not require a checkpoint or `ship:push` just to
create a fresh branch; preserve and carry the current task's changes. For
post-merge rotation, follow `new-branch`'s dedicated safety checks.

For an explicitly authorized branch-wide checkpoint, publish one complete
snapshot with `corepack pnpm ship:push -m "<specific change>"`. Do not publish
separate checkpoints for delegates or intermediate edits.

## Before you ship

Before you commit, push, or merge, check `git log --oneline -5`, `git status`,
and `gh pr list --head <branch>` for the current PR. If the work you were
about to do just landed, continue from the latest branch snapshot.

Do not rebase or merge `origin/main` just to clear behind status or restart
checks. Rebase or merge it only when GitHub reports an actual conflict; for a
shared branch, prefer a normal merge.

## Reading a Codex peer's intent

Relaying between agents by hand is the user's most tedious job — don't make
him paste what a Codex session is doing. Read its transcript yourself:

```bash
ls ~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-*.jsonl
```

Each line is a JSON event; `payload.type == "user_message"` is what the user
asked, `payload.type == "agent_message"` is what it answered — enough to learn
a peer's task without interrupting it or the user.
