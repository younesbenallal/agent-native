# Integration Webhooks

## Rule

Integration webhooks (Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp, email, Google Docs, etc.) must
**enqueue work to SQL and return 200 immediately**, then process the work in a
**separate fresh function execution** kicked off by a self-fired HTTP POST. SQL
is always the source of truth. Long-lived hosts use an in-process retry loop as
a best-effort safety net; serverless deployments must use an external durable
sweep when recovery cannot depend on a process staying alive.

Do not run agent loops inside the webhook handler itself. Do not rely on
fire-and-forget `Promise`s after `return`ing from a serverless handler — they get
killed when the function freezes.

## Why

Messaging platforms expect a 200 response within a tight window — Slack will
retry after 3 seconds, and a retried event triggers duplicate agent runs. At the
same time, an agent loop replying to the message can take 30–60+ seconds because
it may make multiple LLM calls and tool calls.

Past attempts that don't work cross-host:

- **Fire-and-forget `Promise.then(...)` after returning** — Lambda/Vercel/CF
  freeze the execution context the moment the response goes out. The promise
  is silently killed, the user gets no reply, and there's no error in the
  logs.
- **A platform background function as the queue** — host-specific execution is
  useful as a delivery mechanism, but it cannot replace the SQL row or atomic
  claim shared by every host.
- **Cloudflare `event.waitUntil()`** — CF Workers only, not portable.
- **Vercel Fluid / `after()`** — Vercel-only, gated behind specific runtimes.
- **A long-lived in-process queue** — fine on a single Node box, but on
  serverless every cold start gets a fresh queue and any pending work is
  lost.

The only universal answer: **persist the work, then trigger a brand new
function execution to do it.** SQL is the queue, a self-webhook is the trigger,
and a recurring job is the safety net.

## The Flow

                                                                  │
                            6. claimPendingTask(id) → status='processing'

                            9. markTaskCompleted(id)

```

The webhook handler does as little as possible. The fresh function execution
that handles `_process-task` gets its own full timeout budget for the agent
loop.

## Settings › Channels

With the `settings-redesign` flag on, each app's Channels page
(`packages/core/src/client/integrations/ChannelsPage.tsx`) lists the channels
the deployment mounts. It reads and changes them only through two core
actions, which the agent calls too:

- `list-messaging-channels` (GET): each mounted adapter's state, webhook URL,
  and its own `getRequiredEnvKeys()`. For owners and admins each key also says
  where its value comes from (`saved`, `environment`, `elsewhere`, or null).
- `manage-messaging-channel`: `save-credentials`, `enable`, `disable`,
  `remove-credentials`, `register-webhook`. Owners and admins only, checked in
  `integrations/channel-settings.ts`.

Rules that keep it working in every app:

- Credentials are saved as workspace-scoped secrets for the org (`solo:<email>`
  without one), not through `/env-vars`, so no template has to declare channel
  keys. `resolveSecret` finds them in Settings requests and in webhooks, which
  run as the admin who turned the channel on.
- An adapter key the runtime reads only from `process.env` sets
  `deploymentOnly: true` in `getRequiredEnvKeys()` (Google Docs' service
  account key). The page then points at the deployment instead of offering an
  input, and `save-credentials` refuses it.
- The plugin publishes its adapters and the enable/disable and webhook
  registration side effects through `setMountedChannels`
  (`integrations/mounted-channels.ts`); the `/:platform/enable|disable|setup`
  routes and the actions share them. Add a new side effect there, not in a
  route.
- A new channel adapter needs a catalog entry in `integrations/catalog.ts`;
  `catalog.spec.ts` fails until the catalog and
  `BUILT_IN_INTEGRATION_ADAPTER_IDS` match. Add its about line under
  `settingsShell.channels.about.*` in every core locale.
- `webhookSetup` decides the page's rows: `manual` shows the webhook URL to
  copy, `automatic` adds a Register button (`register-webhook`), and no value
  (Google Docs) shows no webhook URL.
- An app adds its own settings to one channel's page with
  `registerChannelSettingsExtensions([{ id, platform, component }])` from
  `@agent-native/core/client/settings`, at module scope next to its settings
  route. Clips registers Slack link previews this way.

## SQL Schema

The pending-task queue lives in `integration_pending_tasks`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS integration_pending_tasks (
  id                 TEXT    PRIMARY KEY,
  platform           TEXT    NOT NULL,
  external_thread_id TEXT    NOT NULL,
  payload            TEXT    NOT NULL,   -- JSON-serialized IncomingMessage
  owner_email        TEXT    NOT NULL,
  org_id             TEXT,
  status             TEXT    NOT NULL,   -- pending | processing | completed | failed
  attempts           INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  dispatch_attempts  INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  last_dispatch_at   INTEGER,
  last_dispatch_outcome TEXT,
  dispatch_scope     TEXT,             -- persisted channel scope for recovery
  error_message      TEXT,
  created_at         INTEGER NOT NULL,
  updated_at         INTEGER NOT NULL,
  completed_at       INTEGER
);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_pending_tasks_status_created
  ON integration_pending_tasks(status, created_at);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_pending_tasks_dispatch_scope
  ON integration_pending_tasks(platform, dispatch_scope);
```

The store layer creates this lazily on first use via `ensureTable()` and uses
PostgreSQL `BIGINT` columns for millisecond timestamps and counters.

`claimPendingTask` is the critical concurrency primitive: it atomically flips
`pending` → `processing` and increments `attempts`, returning `null` if another
worker beat us to it. Both the initial dispatch and every recovery sweep
funnel through the same processor endpoint, and `claimPendingTask` is what
prevents the same task from being processed twice.

### Netlify durable recovery

The portable self-dispatch remains the default. To emit and use Netlify's
acknowledged background worker plus a one-minute scheduled recovery function,
set `AGENT_INTEGRATION_DURABLE_DISPATCH=true` at build and runtime. A production
rollout can be narrowed with the comma-separated
`AGENT_INTEGRATION_DURABLE_DISPATCH_SCOPES` allowlist. Supported values are
`<platform>:*`, `<platform>:<external-thread-id>`, and, for adapters that expose
one, `<platform>:<channel-id>` (for example `slack:C123`).
Channel-scoped handoffs persist that scope separately from the provider thread
identity so a later bounded recovery sweep applies the same allowlist decision.

Workspace deploys emit this pair only for the Dispatch control-plane app, which
owns workspace messaging integrations. Standalone templates emit their own
pair when the same flag is enabled.

The background handoff waits only for Netlify's enqueue acknowledgement, not
for the agent loop. A failed or non-2xx acknowledgement falls back to the
portable processor. The scheduled function calls the HMAC-authenticated,
bounded `/retry-stuck-tasks` route; its atomic compare-and-set update prevents
overlapping sweeps from dispatching the same stale row twice.
Rows acknowledged by the 15-minute background worker use a 16-minute stale
cutoff, while portable synchronous dispatches retain the shorter serverless
cutoff. Apply that lease predicate before `LIMIT` so healthy long runs cannot
hide recoverable work. The background processor writes its lease marker in the
same atomic update that claims the row; best-effort dispatch telemetry is not
trusted for replay safety.

## Adding a New Platform Adapter

1. **Implement `PlatformAdapter`** in `packages/core/src/integrations/adapters/<platform>.ts`:

   ```ts
   export function myPlatformAdapter(): PlatformAdapter {
     return {
       platform: "myplatform",
       label: "MyPlatform",
       getRequiredEnvKeys: () => [
         { name: "MYPLATFORM_TOKEN", label: "MyPlatform Bot Token", scope: "global" },
         { name: "MYPLATFORM_SIGNING_SECRET", label: "MyPlatform Signing Secret", scope: "global" },
       ],
       async handleVerification(event) {
         // Platform-specific challenge response, if any
         return { handled: false };
       },
       async verifyWebhook(event) {
         // Verify HMAC/signature with a server-side secret and constant-time comparison.
         // Never leave this as a permissive stub in production.
         return verifyMyPlatformSignature(event);
       },
       async parseIncomingMessage(event) {
         // Map raw payload → IncomingMessage, or null to ignore
         return null;
       },
       async sendResponse(message, context) {
         // POST back to the platform's API
       },
       formatAgentResponse(text) {
         return { text, platformContext: {} };
       },
       async getStatus(baseUrl) {
         return { platform: "myplatform", label: "MyPlatform", enabled: false, configured: false };
       },
     };
   }
   ```

2. **Register it** in `getDefaultAdapters()` inside `plugin.ts`. The webhook,
   queue, processor, and retry job are shared infrastructure — you do not
   write any of that per-adapter.

3. **Declare required env keys** so the secrets/onboarding UI surfaces them.
   See `secrets` and `onboarding` skills.

4. **Update the platform's webhook URL** to point at
   `${baseUrl}/_agent-native/integrations/<platform>/webhook`. For platforms
   with a registration API (Telegram), implement `POST /:platform/setup`.

Never hardcode bot tokens, signing secrets, verification tokens, webhook URLs,
channel/customer identifiers, or copied platform payloads with real private data
inside the adapter, tests, docs, prompts, or fixtures. `getRequiredEnvKeys()`
declares credential names only. Values come from deployment configuration,
registered secrets, OAuth, or scoped credential stores, and tests should use
obvious fake placeholders.

The adapter is **only** responsible for:

- platform-specific verification (signatures, challenges)
- payload → `IncomingMessage` mapping
- agent text → platform format
- delivering the response back to the platform

It does **not** know about the queue, the processor, retries, or the agent
loop. Those are handled by the shared webhook handler.

### Slack non-message events

Slack's Events API also sends events that are not agent messages, such as
`link_shared` for app unfurls. Do not map those into `IncomingMessage` unless
they should actually run the agent. Handle them as short, provider-specific
webhook work: verify the Slack signature, return `200 OK` quickly, and call the
provider API needed for the event (`chat.unfurl` for link previews). If a single
Slack app must handle both agent chat and app unfurls, put a dispatcher in front
of the one Slack Events Request URL and route message events to the integration
webhook flow while routing `link_shared` to the app-specific unfurl handler.

## Long-Running Agent Work

The processor endpoint runs in a fresh function execution with its own full
timeout (typically 30–60s on Netlify/Vercel, longer on background-friendly
hosts). That budget is dedicated entirely to the agent loop — there is no
platform-side timer racing it.

If a single agent run might exceed the function timeout (large multi-step
plans, deep delegation chains), the agent should:

1. Send an interim acknowledgement back to the platform so the user knows the
   request landed (`adapter.sendResponse({ text: "Working on it..." })`).
2. Persist intermediate state in chat-thread data, application state, or a
   recurring job so the next invocation can pick up where this one left off.

The retry job will only re-fire tasks stuck in `processing` for over 5 minutes,
so a normal long-running reply is safe.

## Cross-Platform Considerations

- **Portable correctness, optional host acceleration.** Every host uses SQL,
  HMAC-authenticated processor routes, and atomic claims. A host-specific
  background function or scheduler may provide a more reliable wake-up, but
  disabling it must preserve the portable path.
- **No assumed runtime.** The processor endpoint is a normal H3 handler under
  `/_agent-native/`. It runs wherever the rest of the framework runs.
- **No persistent in-memory state.** The dedup map in the webhook handler is
  best-effort only; the SQL queue is the source of truth. Any cold start
  loses the dedup map but the queue stays consistent.
- **Postgres concurrency.** `claimPendingTask` uses one conditional update with
  `RETURNING`, so the claim and read are one database operation.
- **Self-webhook URL resolution.** The processor URL is built from
  `WEBHOOK_BASE_URL`, `APP_URL`, or `URL` env vars (with `localhost:3000` as
  the dev fallback). Templates that change their public URL must keep one of
  these set.

## Why Fire-and-Forget on Serverless Is Unreliable

The portable webhook path gives the outbound processor request a short head
start but does not wait for the response body, so that initial dispatch is
**not** guaranteed to complete before the function freezes. On a long-lived
host, the in-process retry loop is a best-effort safety net. On Netlify with
durable dispatch enabled, the initial handoff is acknowledged and the external
scheduled function supplies the recovery wake-up for cases where:

- The serverless platform froze the handler before the outbound `fetch`
  flushed its bytes.
- The processor function 502'd or cold-started slow enough to time out.
- The processor itself was killed mid-agent-loop (function timeout, container
  shutdown, deploy mid-run).

Tasks stuck in `pending` for >90s or `processing` for >5min get re-fired up to
3 times. After 3 attempts they're marked `failed` permanently so we stop
spamming the processor.

**Never assume the initial dispatch succeeded.** Rely on the SQL queue, atomic
claim, and a recovery mechanism whose lifetime is independent of the original
request. An in-process timer alone is not that mechanism on serverless.

## Debugging Checklist

1. **Platform sent the webhook?** Check the platform's delivery logs (Slack
   admin, Telegram `getWebhookInfo`).
2. **Webhook handler returned 200?** If not, the platform retries — look for
   duplicate task rows. Signature failures return 401.
3. **Task in the queue?** `SELECT * FROM integration_pending_tasks WHERE
   external_thread_id = '...' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5`.
4. **Status?** `pending` means the processor never picked it up — check that
   `_process-task` is reachable from the box itself (the self-fetch must work
   over the public URL). `processing` for over 5 minutes means the processor
   died mid-run — a live recovery sweep will pick it up.
5. **Failed?** Check `error_message` and `attempts`. After 3 attempts the row
   is parked at `failed` and won't be retried.
6. **Reply not delivered?** The processor likely succeeded but
   `adapter.sendResponse` failed — check the adapter's outbound logs.

## Automation connectors

Workflow systems such as n8n and Zapier are not messaging channels. Do not add
them as `PlatformAdapter`s or route them through `provider-api`.

For n8n-style workflow invocation and callbacks, use
`@agent-native/core/automation` with static workflow IDs and allow-listed
origins. Agents provide structured input, never a target URL or credential.
Callbacks must verify a configured secret/signature, claim a durable event ID,
enqueue work through the established queue, and acknowledge quickly.

Zapier is blueprint-only unless the app implements Zapier's explicit REST Hook
subscribe/unsubscribe contract or configures a separate Zapier MCP connection.
Do not imply a generic Zapier workflow-execution API exists.
