# Address Feedback

Use this skill when the user shares a feedback document, issue, thread, or pasted notes and asks you to address the feedback.

The default posture is judgment plus action: fix clear, verified bugs and
handle concrete design/UX feedback about existing surfaces. In a Slack sweep,
new capability requests still need the invoking identity's `:upvote:`; praise,
status updates, merge/review requests, bot forwards, duplicates, and noise stay
out of scope. Do not exclude Design feedback just because it is visual or
subjective. Before leaving a report with another owner, confirm current thread
status or linked work; an eye alone is not active ownership. If a previous run
claimed an out-of-scope item, keep `👀` and record **Skipped** once in the
thread. Never remove reactions; newer thread evidence determines its status.

## Choose the fix altitude

Before coding, name the smallest invariant that explains the report and the
boundary that owns it. Use the evidence to choose the altitude:

- One isolated report -> fix the local seam and add a focused regression check.
- Repeated or cross-surface reports -> consider the shared primitive or
  contract, but only after confirming the reports share the same failure mode.
- Missing capability or wrong tool -> fix discovery, the registry, or the
  action contract rather than coaching the agent around the gap.
- Source behavior differs from the reported live behavior -> check the build,
  deploy, and version state before changing code.

Do not turn one data point into a global agent rule. For subjective feedback,
state the underlying invariant and wait for repeated evidence before broadening
it. Keep a concrete local fix when it solves the reported boundary; the goal is
the right abstraction, not the most general one.

## Prerequisites

- If no link or feedback text is provided, ask for it.
- Read the repo `AGENTS.md` before touching code.
- Use the relevant connector/plugin/skill for the source when available, instead of scraping authenticated pages.
- For Slack, use the connected identity contract in
  `address-feedback-with-replies`; verify the invoking user's profile and use
  that same identity for all reads, reactions, replies, and read-backs.
- Before starting work, search available task history and local Git/PR metadata for the exact feedback link or issue identifiers. Reuse existing work instead of creating a duplicate fix.

## Steps

1. Read the feedback source.

   | Source | Reader |
   | --- | --- |
   | Notion link | Notion connector or Notion skill |
   | Google Docs/Drive link | Google Drive connector or Google Docs skill |
   | Linear link | Linear connector if installed; otherwise ask for pasted content |
   | GitHub issue or PR | GitHub connector or `gh issue view` / `gh pr view` |
   | Slack thread | Slack connector with the invoking user's identity |
   | Public URL | Web browsing |
   | Pasted text | Read directly |

   Use web browsing only for public URLs. Auth-gated docs usually need their matching connector. For Slack threads, use the invoking user's connected Slack identity for the parent, replies, reactions, and Slack metadata; fetch linked external artifacts through their owning connector or public URL.

2. Check whether this defect has already been reported.

   A feedback channel holds months of reports and nobody remembers all of them,
   so the same defect gets filed by different people weeks apart and every
   filing reads as new. One recorded case: the same Clips recording bug was
   filed almost word-for-word 29 days apart by the same reporter, and neither
   message mentions the other. Another defect was reported fifteen times by
   nine people across three months, was announced as fixed once in the middle,
   and was reported again two weeks later.

   Search before fixing, going back at least three months: the source channel
   in the reporter's words and in your own, Sentry, first-party Agent-Native
   Analytics error issues, and merged PR titles. Search the feature name, the
   error text, and the surface separately - repeat reports rarely share
   vocabulary.

   - **No prior report** — proceed normally.
   - **Prior report, no fix landed** — say how long it has been open. The person
     forwarding it to you is likely seeing it for the second time too.
   - **Prior report, fix landed** — this is a regression, and the bar is now
     different. Patching it again and reporting done is exactly how it returns a
     third time. Find why the first fix stopped holding, and leave behind
     something that fails when it breaks again: a test that reproduces the
     user's path, or an assertion in the flow the report names.

   Report the repeat explicitly, with dates and reporters. A defect on its third
   report is not a bug ticket, it is a missing check — and the missing check is
   the deliverable, not the patch.

## Clarification gate

Before asking a reporter for clarification, read the complete parent thread,
every reply, and every accessible linked artifact. Build a short ledger of the
surface, URL, repro, exact error, screenshots or files, run or request IDs, and
answers already present. A detail found anywhere in that evidence is available
context - never ask the reporter to repeat it.

Look for resolution or ownership signals before classifying an item as missing
evidence. A substantive reply from the invoking Slack identity, a legacy
`@agent-native` message, or any participant that identifies the cause, supplies
the repro, links a fix, or says the issue is fixed, landed, or being fixed is
evidence, not a clarification gap. Verify the claim when needed and record the
item as already owned, fixed, or in progress; do not ask a duplicate question
while that work is being verified or handed off. Ask only when one concrete
reporter detail still blocks a safe fix to an otherwise clear bug after this
review. Do not ask a subjective product question merely to choose between
plausible UX options.

Every human-facing feedback reply starts with a brief thank-you. When
clarification is genuinely required, say `thanks for the feedback -` first and
then ask one specific question. `Clarification needed` is an internal ledger
state, never the opening or the prose of the reporter-facing reply.

3. Decompose and categorize every actionable item.

   Build a compact checklist before changing code. For each item, record the
   symptom, expected behavior, evidence, and owning surface: UI, action/tool,
   data model, provider/runtime, or product policy.

   - **Bug**: Broken behavior, crash, wrong data, dead link, package/API mismatch, or captured exception. Separate the observed failure from the proposed remedy. Fix verified breakage at its owning seam even when the suggested UX change is out of scope; skip only that remedy. If the failure is unverified, keep it evidence-limited or ask for the detail that would unblock reproduction.
   - **UX suggestion**: Design, discoverability, workflow, or feature feedback. For concrete critique of an existing surface, choose and implement the smallest coherent treatment when it is in scope. A request for a new capability still needs the invoking identity's `:upvote:` in a Slack sweep.
   - **Question or unclear**: Missing detail, contradictory feedback, or behavior you cannot inspect after the clarification gate. Ask or flag it only when the missing detail still blocks a safe fix.
   - **Out of scope**: Outside this repo, already shipped, intentionally unsupported, or too low-signal. Note briefly and skip.

4. For data, permissions, or resource-lifecycle feedback, verify the whole capability boundary before calling it UX.

   - Check the supported create/read/update/delete lifecycle, including whether the backend/action exists when a UI control is missing.
   - Inspect both the UI and the shared action/tool surface so agent and UI behavior stay in parity.
   - Verify scope semantics such as owner/private, organization, shared, and public access. Test owner and non-owner paths with safe fixtures or read-only checks; never use another user's production data to test access.
   - Treat possible cross-user or cross-organization exposure as a security/correctness bug and verify it before proposing polish.
   - Keep undefined product policy separate from implementation bugs. If supported source types or scope semantics are not defined, flag the contract question instead of inventing behavior.

5. Check Sentry and first-party Agent-Native Analytics when the feedback smells
   like an error.

   - Use the Sentry skill/plugin if available, or the repo's Sentry scripts if documented.
   - Use authenticated Agent-Native Analytics `list-error-issues` for captured
     client/server issue groups, then `get-error-issue` for stack and occurrence
     details. Use the linked session replay when it is available.
   - Search by route, stack symbol, error text, and symptom keywords.
   - Default org is `builder-io` unless the user specifies another.
   - Query both when available. If Sentry is unavailable or rate-limited,
     Analytics is the fallback for errors it captured.
   - Cite the matching issue ID or link and say which source it came from.
   - If a source cannot be read, record it as unavailable; do not say nothing
     matched for that source.

## Fix-altitude gate

Before editing a verified bug, choose the narrowest seam supported by the
evidence:

- One isolated report -> fix the owning local seam and add a regression check.
- Repeated or cross-surface evidence -> inspect the shared primitive or
  contract before patching a leaf.
- Missing capability or wrong tool -> fix discovery, registry, or action-contract
  wiring.
- Source-vs-live mismatch -> diagnose build/deploy state before changing source.
- Do not turn one data point into a global agent instruction. For subjective
  feedback, name the invariant and require repeated evidence before broadening
  it.

6. Fix verified bugs and actionable UX feedback that is in scope.

   - Verify before fixing: reproduce locally, read the relevant code, inspect logs, or confirm with a stack trace.
   - Keep each fix narrow and mapped to a feedback item.
   - Follow existing project conventions and nearby patterns.
   - In a task-owned worktree, create or switch to a safe task branch when
     needed without asking; preserve local changes and never move a branch
     used by another worktree. In a shared checkout, ask before creating or
     switching branches unless the user authorized that exact operation.
     Stash, reset, force-push, and PR creation still require explicit scope.
   - Add or update focused tests when the bug risk warrants it.

7. Treat UX feedback with product judgment.

   Do not add visible UI as the default response. Address the underlying user
   problem first, then choose the smallest change that makes the current state,
   decision, action, or recovery path clearer.

   - Make the current intent, state, and meaningful next step easier to find.
   - Remove competing or redundant elements before adding controls, helper
     text, banners, top-level navigation, or always-open panels.
   - Put secondary or advanced actions in a `DropdownMenu`, `Popover`, `Sheet`,
     `Collapsible`, tabs, or another contextual surface. Keep essential meaning,
     labels, focus, hit targets, and recovery in the default path.
   - Improve empty, loading, and error states around the user's actual need.

   When the user has corrected the same visual preference more than once, treat
   it as an acceptance criterion for the surface, not as a one-off copy edit.
   State the underlying invariant before coding, such as “the default state
   makes one next decision obvious and defers secondary detail,” then check the
   rendered result against it. A screenshot showing unrelated forms, repeated
   explanatory copy, documentation links, or competing controls in the default
   state fails the review. Subtract that competition instead of explaining the
   UI with more copy.

   When proposing a UX change, write it as: what to change, why it helps, and the tradeoff. Keep each proposal short.

8. Verify changed behavior.

   - Run the smallest relevant test or typecheck command.
   - For UI fixes, inspect the actual screen with a browser tool you already
     have. Do not write a browser-automation script to check a small fix.
   - For resource visibility or lifecycle changes, verify both the screen and
     shared action/tool behavior, including owner versus non-owner access when
     relevant.
   - If you cannot run a useful verification, record the reason internally. In
     the user-facing reply, use only "[plain-language item] - Verification
     pending. Timing not confirmed yet." unless the user explicitly asks why.

## User-Facing Reply

Keep the outward reply to a status update, not an implementation report. The
technical investigation, reproduction details, test results, file names, and
internal reasoning stay internal unless the user explicitly asks for them.

For every actionable item, use a plain-language label and one short status:

- For a requested change: **Fixed** or **Not fixed yet**.
- For an unclear request: **Needs clarification**.
- For a declined, skipped, or out-of-scope request: **Not planned** or **Not in
  scope**.
- For any item that still needs verification: **Verification pending**.

Add one timing phrase to every status. If the current ship is expected to
finish that day and the completed fix is confirmed to be included in that
ship, use "Expected live by EOD." Otherwise use "Timing not confirmed yet."
For items that are not planned or out of scope, use "No live date." Do not
invent a release date.

If a requested change is implemented but not yet verified, use
"[plain-language item] - Verification pending. Timing not confirmed yet."
instead of **Fixed** until verification is complete.

When this skill is used by `address-feedback-with-replies`, that skill's Slack
reply states take precedence: a Slack thread must receive **Fixed**, **In
progress**, or **Clarification needed** for the current run. **In progress** is
valid only when the invoking Slack identity, a legacy `@agent-native` message,
or another participant already owns the issue or is actively fixing it; it is
an open handoff that the next run must resolve to **Fixed** or **Clarification
needed**. Do not post **Not fixed yet**, **Needs
clarification**, or a bare **Verification pending** status in Slack. Ask one
concrete, plain-language clarification question only when reporter or product
input is still missing after the complete-thread and resolution-signal checks.
If the invoking Slack identity, a legacy `@agent-native` message, or another
participant already found, fixed, or is fixing the issue, do not ask the
reporter to restate it - verify the claim or continue the existing ownership
instead. Start any **In progress** or clarification reply
with a thank-you. For clarification, ask the question second;
**Clarification needed** remains an internal ledger state and must not appear as
the reporter-facing opening. **Clarification needed** is the one timing
exception: do not give a live estimate until the question is answered and the
fix is complete. If only internal test, deployment, or tooling verification is
unavailable, keep that blocker internal, do not post an external Slack status
solely for that reason, and resume the thread after verification is available.
Do not turn it into a reporter question. Keep the no-technical-details rule in
all cases.

Use this format:

```md
## Feedback Status
- [plain-language item] - Fixed. Expected live by EOD.
- [plain-language item] - Not fixed yet. Timing not confirmed yet.
- [plain-language item] - Needs clarification. Timing not confirmed yet.
- [plain-language item] - Not planned. No live date.
```

Do not include implementation details, technical explanations, file paths,
line numbers, test counts, PR numbers, worktree names, stack traces, or
internal labels in the user-facing reply. Do not add separate sections for
bugs, UX suggestions, skipped items, or technical evidence. Keep each item to
one short sentence.

## Avoid

- Do not agree with every suggestion by default.
- Do not bundle unrelated cleanups.
- Do not implement UX changes that make an important screen busier without explicit user approval.
- Do not claim a UI change is done without browser verification when a local app can be run.
- Do not invent Sentry or Agent-Native Analytics matches, affected users, or
  reproduction steps.
- Do not expose the technical details used to verify or implement the work unless the user asks for them.
