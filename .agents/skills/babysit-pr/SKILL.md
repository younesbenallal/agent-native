  Monitor a PR and fix CI or review feedback. Use standalone, or from /ship to
  continue through its authorized guarded merge instead of stopping at green.
user-invocable: true
scope: dev
metadata:
  internal: true
---

Monitor PR #$ARGUMENTS in the current repo and fix CI failures and human or bot
review feedback. A standalone `/babysit-pr` may stop after 30 minutes of green
CI and no new feedback. When invoked by `/ship`, honor its inherited
`ship_mode` in this foreground task. `/ship` and standalone `/babysit-pr` stay
foreground-only; do not create or resume a durable watcher or use PR leases.

A worktree is a valid PR checkout. When monitoring from one, keep Git and
GitHub commands in that worktree's cwd and current branch; do not copy changes
to the shared checkout or require that an agent publish from the root checkout.

## Branch-wide Snapshot Rule

During `/babysit-pr`, the PR remains the unit of review and the shared checkout
is the branch snapshot. At the first tick, record dirty paths and unpushed
commits; publish the requested initial work only after verifying that every
candidate belongs to this PR's requested fix. If unrelated or incomplete
concurrent work is present, preserve it for its owner and wait. On later ticks,
inspect the tree before every push. Publish only a complete, coherent set of
currently known fixes for failing CI, PR feedback, a real merge conflict, or
an explicit user request. Batch multiple feedback items and delegate changes
into one update; do not create a commit for each finding, checkpoint, or timer
tick. Every new head reruns affected checks and resets the soak. Use
`corepack pnpm ship:push -m` with a subject naming the actual fix (for example,
`fix: deduplicate chat start checkpoints`); the helper rejects an omitted or
generic subject. A clean tree, `origin/main` drift, queued checks, or a timer
tick is not a reason to commit or push. Never publish unrelated concurrent
work, and never revert, stash, or overwrite it.

When an actionable fix is changing, collect all known related CI and review
findings, validate the combined fix, then publish one coherent snapshot to the
existing PR. Do not push incremental snapshots just to start CI early; the
latest head needs a stable run before merge. The final clean-tree and
merge-soak gates still apply before merging, except when the user explicitly
invokes `/ship-now`.

**If no PR number is given**, auto-detect it: get the current branch (`git branch --show-current`), find the open PR for it (`gh pr list --head <branch> --state open --json number --limit 1`). If no open PR exists, check recent merged/closed PRs. Only ask the user if no PR can be found.

## Setup

At the start and on every resumed tick, query the PR:

```bash
gh pr view <number> --json state,mergedAt,closedAt,headRefName,headRefOid,mergeCommit
```

If the query fails or is ambiguous, stay foreground-only until its state is
known. A closed, unmerged PR ends babysitting and is reported as unsuccessful.
If a PR is already merged under inherited `ship_mode=merge-authorized`,
continue the post-merge path here. Standalone and ready-only invocations report
an unexpected merge without rotating.

1. Run one foreground tick immediately and continue until this mode's endpoint.
   Do not create or mutate automations for this workflow.
2. Before each PR write, reread the live state. Push normally (never force).
   On a non-fast-forward rejection, fetch and verify the remote PR head. If it
   does not already contain the local commits, confirm the tree is clean and
   those commits belong to this PR, merge the refreshed `origin/<branch>` into
   the current branch, resolve and test, then recheck the live head before
   pushing. Never retry the same stale push, rebase, or force-push. Never
   update from `origin/main` unless GitHub reports a confirmed `CONFLICTING`
   PR; then use a normal merge, never a rebase. A behind count or pending
   checks are not conflicts. Guard PR merges with
   `--match-head-commit <live_head_oid>`; a stale-head rejection is a retry
   signal, not a reason to stop the requested work.
3. Track the last actionable item: new human/bot feedback, a CI fix, conflict
   resolution, or an intentional commit/push.
4. For standalone `/babysit-pr`, stop after 30 minutes with green GitHub Actions
   CI and no new actionable item. Under `/ship` with `ship_mode=merge-authorized`,
   keep working through the 10-minute merge gate and guarded merge. With
   `ship_mode=ready-only`, fix CI and review feedback until the ready-PR gate
   holds, then leave the PR open.

After an actionable fix or push, reset the applicable clock: standalone's
30-minute quiet-green timer or `/ship`'s 10-minute merge soak. The `/ship` soak
starts only once every merge condition below holds; it never waits for 30
minutes of quiet.

### Loop discipline — read this, it is the part people get wrong

- **Cadence: tick every 60–120 seconds while the PR is active** (CI running, recent pushes, or feedback within the last few minutes). Only relax toward ~3 minutes once the PR is genuinely quiet (all checks green, no new commits or comments for a while). Tight cadence is for observing status, not for publishing more often. Coordinate concurrent edits with the owning task; delegates do not publish.
- **Keep the foreground loop moving.** Do not end `/ship` because CI, review, or
  a background command is pending. Use short interruptible waits and check
  again in this task.
- **Do not publish an incomplete snapshot to avoid slow local validation.** Use the narrowest meaningful local check when full validation is slow or contaminated, record exact results, and let the current head's CI finish. If CI or review identifies a fix, batch the currently known actionable items and publish one complete update.
- **Every tick, expect new local files.** On an active shared branch, concurrent
  agents may edit the checkout continuously. Re-run Step 0 every single tick
  to detect actionable changes, but publish only the fixes allowed by the
  Branch-wide Snapshot Rule above.

## Each tick

**Step 0 — always do this first, before anything else:**

```bash
if ! git fetch origin --quiet; then
  echo "Cannot refresh origin refs; stop before checking unpublished commits." >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

Immediately query the live PR state with
`gh pr view $ARGUMENTS --json state,mergedAt,closedAt,headRefName,headRefOid,mergeCommit`.
If the query fails, do not run branch, review, or CI checks; retry on the next
foreground tick. A closed but unmerged PR ends babysitting and is reported as
unsuccessful. A merged PR is a
terminal state for standalone `/babysit-pr` and inherited `ship_mode=ready-only`
(report the unexpected merge and do not rotate). Under inherited
`ship_mode=merge-authorized`, continue the `/ship` post-merge path below before
cleanup. Never treat PR merge alone as completion of the parent ship goal.

For an open PR, inspect the branch snapshot:

```bash
git status --short
git diff --name-only
if git show-ref --verify --quiet "refs/remotes/origin/$(git branch --show-current)"; then
  git log --oneline --decorate "origin/$(git branch --show-current)"..HEAD -- . ':(exclude)learnings.md' ':(exclude)bridge/**' ':(exclude)data/**'
else
  git log --oneline --decorate HEAD --not --remotes=origin -- . ':(exclude)learnings.md' ':(exclude)bridge/**' ':(exclude)data/**'
fi
```

After the status check, run `corepack pnpm ship:push -m` with a subject naming the actual fix, and only when the dirty or
unpushed work is the intentional fix for a concrete CI failure, PR feedback,
merge conflict, or explicit user request. If the tree is clean and already
pushed, do nothing. If it is clean with unpushed commits, push them directly
only when those commits are already an intentional actionable fix; never create
a new maintenance commit merely to make the branch look current.

Every tick starts here, no exceptions: on an active shared branch local files
can change within minutes, so re-check before every actionable push.

**Never `git stash` concurrent changes.** Stashes get orphaned, and a stash named `babysit-tickN-concurrent-work-*` left on the source branch while babysit-pr's PR ships without it is exactly how real work gets lost. If you see local changes you don't recognize, preserve them for their owner; do not hide them in a stash or commit them here.

**Step 1 — check for merge conflicts:**

1. Run `gh pr view $ARGUMENTS --json mergeable --jq '.mergeable'`.
2. If `CONFLICTING`: bring `main` in and resolve. First inspect the worktree
   and unpushed commits; do not run the merge until the publishable-path check
   `git status --short -- . ':(exclude)learnings.md' ':(exclude)bridge/**'
   ':(exclude)data/**'` and the branch-specific unpublished-commit check in
   Step 0 are empty. The unpublished-commit check is also scoped to
   publishable paths, so excluded-only commits do not block recovery. Preserve
   and report excluded paths; they do not block
   recovery unless the merge itself touches them.
   Before merging, compare the local checkout with the live PR head:

   ```bash
   pr_head=$(gh pr view $ARGUMENTS --json headRefOid --jq '.headRefOid')
   if [ "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" != "$pr_head" ]; then
     echo "Local HEAD is not the live PR head; stop and let the branch owner reconcile it." >&2
     exit 1
   fi
   ```

   If either publishable-path check is non-empty, do not attempt an in-place
   isolation. Preserve the exact dirty paths and unpublished commits, leave the
   checkout untouched, and wait for the owning session to publish or move its
   work. A separate clean PR worktree may perform this recovery when one is
   already available. Never use `git stash`, reset, restore, or a temporary
   branch as a substitute for retaining concurrent work.

   Do not merge an obsolete local head.
   **Publish any intentional actionable fix first (Step 0)**, after verifying
   every dirty path and unpushed commit belongs to that fix; then prefer a
   **merge** over a rebase —
   `git fetch origin main && git merge --no-edit
   origin/main` — because this branch is shared with concurrent agents and a
   rebase would rewrite history and require a force-push that can clobber their
   unpushed commits. Resolve the conflicts (for `pnpm-lock.yaml`, take one side
   with `git checkout --theirs -- pnpm-lock.yaml` then regenerate with `pnpm
   install --lockfile-only` against the merged `package.json`), complete the
   merge commit, and push (a normal push, never `--force`). This resets the soak
   timer. If unrelated or incomplete concurrent work keeps the worktree dirty,
   preserve it and wait for its owner instead of stashing, restoring, or
   forcing the merge. Do not merge `origin/main` again while the PR is
   `MERGEABLE` or `UNKNOWN`, or while checks are merely pending; a conflict-free
   PR does not need another main sync. Merge from main only to resolve a
   confirmed conflict. Because this branch is shared, use a normal merge;
   never rebase.
3. If `MERGEABLE` or `UNKNOWN`: proceed. (`mergeStateStatus: BLOCKED` with `mergeable: MERGEABLE` just means required checks are still pending/red — that is not a conflict; keep going.)

## Latest-feedback handoff

If the PR body or branch cites `/review-latest-feedback`, treat its start
cursor, grouped reports, evidence links, and disposition table as part of the
PR's review state. At the first tick, record that handoff. On every later tick
before the merge gate, re-read the handoff and check for new Slack replies,
GitHub feedback, and Sentry findings after its cursor using the configured
connectors. Re-query first-party Agent-Native Analytics error issues with
`list-error-issues` and its available filters; it has no time cursor and caps
results at 100, so record bounded coverage and do not claim exhaustive newness.
A new actionable report resets the soak timer and must reach either
a verified **Fixed** result with a concise reply and `✅`, a verified
**Shipped** result with a concise reply, a verified **Live verified** result
(reply only when informative), or a non-fixed terminal ledger disposition
with its existing `👀` before merge (`✅` only for **Fixed**). An
active/evidence-limited disposition or a reply without one of those outcomes
blocks merge; the eye remains on every claimed item. Reactions are append-only;
newer thread evidence controls the current disposition.
Evidence-limited or active dispositions retain the workflow's eye; it remains
after resolution. Keep active and terminal state in thread text or linked
work; do not repeat a status already recorded. If a connector is unavailable,
record it as unavailable in the recap rather than treating it as no findings.

**Then proceed with PR checks:**

1. Check for review comments and review summaries from humans and bots — **EVERY tick, with no exceptions.**

   > ⚠️ **Review bots (Builder, Copilot, etc.) RE-REVIEW on every push and post a brand-new round of comments each time.** A PR commonly accumulates several rounds. You MUST re-check on every single tick — including "quiet" ticks where you're only waiting on CI — and you must keep checking right up until the moment you merge.
   >
   > **Never filter comments by a "since <timestamp>" window.** A forward-looking timestamp silently skips rounds that were posted *before* your last reply (e.g. a round that landed between the first review and when you replied), and "0 new since X" reads as "all addressed" when it is not. This exact mistake left two whole review rounds unanswered on PR #1097 (2026-06-08).

   Instead, determine coverage by **reply state**: list every top-level review comment that does **not** yet have a reply, across all pages and all rounds. Stream every comment with `--jq '.[]'` (concatenates cleanly across pages), then slurp:
   ```bash
   gh api --paginate repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/$ARGUMENTS/comments --jq '.[]' \
     | jq -s '
       ([ .[] | .in_reply_to_id // empty ]) as $replied
       | .[]
       | select((.in_reply_to_id // null) == null)              # top-level comments only
       | select(.id as $id | ($replied | index($id)) | not)     # …with no reply yet
       | {id, user: .user.login, path, line: (.line // .original_line), snippet: (.body[0:200])}'
   ```
   (Bind the id with `.id as $id` first — `index(.id)` would evaluate `.id` against the `$replied` array, not the comment, and error out.) If that command prints anything, there is unaddressed feedback — fix or reply to each (see "Responding to feedback") before you consider the PR clean. Also re-read the latest review **summary** bodies each tick (bots restate their findings here):
   ```bash
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/$ARGUMENTS/reviews --jq '.[] | select(.body != null and .body != "") | {user: .user.login, state, submitted_at, body: .body[0:1000]}'
   ```
   Treat the count of unaddressed comments (not a timestamp) as the source of truth for "is there feedback to handle".

2. Check CI status:
   ```bash
   gh pr checks $ARGUMENTS
   ```

3. **If new human or bot feedback includes real bugs or requested changes**:
   - Read the relevant files
   - Fix the issues
   - Run `pnpm run prep` to verify locally
   - Run `corepack pnpm ship:push -m` with a subject naming the actual fix to publish the complete fix snapshot
   - Reply inline to each addressed inline comment, or post a PR comment summarizing addressed items when the feedback was in a review body
   - Reset the applicable clock described above

4. **If GitHub Actions CI is failing** (lint, test, typecheck, build):
   - Investigate the failure logs
   - Fix the root cause
   - Run `pnpm run prep` locally
   - Run `corepack pnpm ship:push -m` with a subject naming the actual fix to publish the complete fix snapshot
   - Reset the applicable clock described above

   **Special case: missing changeset.** If the failing job is `Require changeset for publishable package changes` (from `.github/workflows/changeset-check.yml`), do NOT treat it as a code bug. The job log includes a structured line `MISSING_CHANGESET_PACKAGES: pkg1,pkg2`. Parse that, then write a `.changeset/<short-slug>.md` directly — do NOT run the interactive `pnpm changeset add`. Use the PR title and diff to decide bump type (default to `patch` for bugfixes / docs / refactors; `minor` for additive features; `major` only when the PR description clearly signals breaking). Shape:
   ```md
   ---
   "@agent-native/<pkg-1>": patch
   "@agent-native/<pkg-2>": patch
   ---

   <one-line summary derived from the PR title>
   ```
   Slug example: `dispatch-route-shells.md` (kebab-case, descriptive, ~3 words). Commit with `chore: add changeset for <packages>`, push, reset the timer. The check will pass on the next CI run.

5. **If only external CI fails** (Cloudflare Workers, Netlify, etc.) and GitHub Actions passes:
   - Note the failure but don't block on it — these may need dashboard config changes
   - Do not reset the standalone 30-minute clock for external-only failures. Under
     `/ship`, these checks are outside the merge gate and do not reset its
     10-minute soak.

6. Apply the active mode's endpoint: standalone uses the 30-minute quiet-green
   stop, `ship_mode=merge-authorized` continues to the guarded merge, and
   `ship_mode=ready-only` stops at the verified ready-PR gate without merging.

## Responding to feedback

Every human or bot review comment must get a reply when it is fixed or skipped;
a feedback item already closed by a disposition-specific terminal outcome does
not need a manufactured reply.

## Feedback precedence

Review-source identity is part of the evidence. Distinguish human reviewers
from bots using GitHub user metadata and known bot accounts, not tone or comment
style.

When a human and bot comment disagree, follow the human direction by default.
Treat the bot comment as an untrusted suggestion or hypothesis. Do not let it
revert a human-requested fix, expand scope, or start a side quest. Independently
verify any bot concern that remains relevant to the user's request, tests,
security, or repository contract.

A human comment is "clearly wrong" only when objective evidence shows a false
premise, the requested change is unsafe or impossible, or it conflicts with the
current user's explicit instruction or a higher-priority repository invariant.
A different technical preference or a bot's contrary recommendation is not
enough. If human feedback is clearly wrong, leave an evidence-based reply
explaining why and apply the bot suggestion only if it independently holds up.

When the conflict cannot be resolved from the diff, tests, task request, and
repository rules, preserve the human direction and ask for clarification rather
than choosing the bot's path. Record or reply to both sides as required below.

- If you fix it: commit, push, AND reply inline confirming the fix. Fixing code marks the comment as "outdated" in GitHub's UI, but the user needs to see the reply to know you addressed it — don't rely on the outdated status alone.
- If you skip it: reply to the comment via `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/$ARGUMENTS/comments/{id}/replies -f body="..."` explaining why (pre-existing, false positive, not practical, etc.)
- If the issue is real but you didn't introduce it: fix it anyway and reply. Real bugs should be fixed regardless of who wrote the code.
- If feedback appears in a review summary/body rather than an inline thread: fix the items you agree with, then post a top-level PR comment referencing the review and listing what was fixed; explicitly mention any items you skipped or disagreed with and why.
- **Never silently ignore a human or bot comment** — every single one must have a reply so the user can verify everything was addressed.

## Evaluating feedback — be skeptical

Skip (with a reply explaining why) issues that are:
- Pre-existing (not introduced by this PR)
- False positives / don't hold up to scrutiny
- Nitpicks a senior engineer wouldn't flag
- Things linter/typechecker catches (CI handles those)
- Style/formatting issues
- Already addressed in a previous commit

Fix issues that are:
- Real runtime bugs introduced by this PR
- Security issues
- CLAUDE.md violations
- Data loss risks

## Merging

In `ship_mode=merge-authorized`, `/babysit-pr` inherits `/ship`'s merge
authorization; do not return "All clear" or stop this foreground task while its
PR is open. In `ship_mode=ready-only`, never merge; stop at the verified ready
PR endpoint and leave the PR open.

Never enable GitHub auto-merge. In `ship_mode=merge-authorized`, admin-merge
when the `/ship` gates hold. For standalone `/babysit-pr`, merge only when the
user explicitly asks. Never merge in `ship_mode=ready-only`.

`/ship-now` is an explicit fast-path exception. When it is invoked, follow
`ship-now`'s local targeted-recovery gate and immediate admin-merge rule instead
of waiting for this section's remote-CI and soak requirements.

When merge authorization applies, all of these must be true **simultaneously
for 10 consecutive minutes** before merging:

1. **No local uncommitted changes** except the documented routine exclusions
2. **No unpushed commits** — the publishable-path `git log` check from Step 0
   must be empty
3. **All GitHub Actions CI green** — Build, Lint, Test, Typecheck, Scaffold E2E, Guard
4. **All review comments addressed** — every human/bot inline comment and review-body item has a verified fix and reply, or a disposition-specific terminal outcome; active/evidence-limited items remain blockers
5. **No merge conflicts** — `gh pr view --json mergeable --jq '.mergeable'` must be `MERGEABLE`

The 10-minute soak timer **resets to zero** whenever the branch is pushed, CI
fails, a new review comment arrives, or merge conflicts appear.

At the end of the 10-minute soak, immediately before merging, revalidate the
entire gate for the still-open PR: current `headRefOid`, `MERGEABLE` state,
required checks green, all review items addressed, no new actionable feedback,
clean worktree, and no unpushed commits. If any condition changed or cannot be
verified, reset the soak and continue monitoring. Capture the head oid from
that final check. Before merging under `/ship`, persist it as
`ship_merge_head_oid=<verified-head-oid>` in the task transcript or active goal.
Keep this exact value through post-merge verification;
never replace it with a live `headRefOid` read after merge. If it is unavailable
after merge, retain the source branch rather than guessing.
Then run:

```bash
gh pr merge <number> --squash --admin --match-head-commit <verified-head-oid>
```

If the head-match guard rejects the merge, restart the soak for the new head
and replace the saved head marker only after final revalidation. When the merge
succeeds under `/ship`, return the saved head marker and immutable
`mergeCommit.oid` to the parent. A resumed wake may recover the merge SHA from
the PR's immutable `mergeCommit.oid`; never recover the merged head from the
mutable live head ref.

## Stop conditions

- For standalone `/babysit-pr` only: no new actionable feedback and GitHub
  Actions green for 30 consecutive minutes
- In `ship_mode=ready-only`: the verified ready-PR endpoint above
- A merged PR completes standalone babysitting; in inherited
  `ship_mode=merge-authorized`, continue through the post-merge ship endpoint
- A closed but unmerged PR ends babysitting, but never completes the ship goal

In `ship_mode=merge-authorized`, never stop at the 30-minute quiet-green
condition. Keep checking and fixing CI/review feedback in this task, merge as
soon as the 10-minute gate holds, then verify `origin/main` and finish branch
disposition. A closed but unmerged PR is a terminal state, not a successful
shipment. In `ship_mode=ready-only`, stop at the verified ready-PR endpoint,
leave the PR open, and do not merge or rotate.

### Post-merge `/ship` continuation

When the foreground task finds the PR merged under inherited
`ship_mode=merge-authorized`, use the immutable `ship_merge_head_oid` saved
before merge and `mergeCommit.oid` from GitHub or the merge result. Never use
the current live `headRefOid` as the merged head. If the saved head marker is
missing, preserve the source branch. Continue through:

1. Fetch origin and verify `mergeCommit.oid` is an ancestor of `origin/main`.
   If it has not arrived yet, retry in the foreground at an interruptible
   cadence of at most 60 seconds.
2. Rerun both final review audits below. If new actionable feedback appears
   after merge, record a post-merge follow-up and retain the source branch.
3. If there is no post-merge follow-up, follow the inherited mode. In
   `ship_mode=merge-authorized`, `/ship` authorizes the safe post-merge rotation
   in this task-owned worktree; run `/new-branch` safety checks and rotate when
   they pass. Retain the source branch if a check fails. In standalone
   babysitting or `ship_mode=ready-only`, retain the source branch unless the
   user requested that exact rotation in this task.

The foreground task owns this continuation; no watcher or lease is required.

PR merge by itself is not parent handoff or goal completion. If the exact head
OID is unavailable, preserve the source branch and report that safe disposition
rather than guessing.

Before the guarded merge or ready-only endpoint, and before post-merge branch
disposition, re-run the unaddressed inline-comments command and inspect every
review body in this task:

```bash
gh api --paginate "repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/$ARGUMENTS/reviews" \
  --jq '.[] | select(.body != "") | {id, user: .user.login, state, submitted_at, body}'
```

Confirm every actionable item in the newest review summaries has a verified
fix and a reply, or a valid terminal disposition, including items without an
inline thread. New review feedback resets the merge soak. Do not stop in
`ready-only` mode or merge in `merge-authorized` mode until both the inline
thread audit and review-body audit are clear. "I replied earlier" is not
sufficient; bots may have posted new rounds since. If either final audit finds
new actionable feedback, fix it in the foreground and restart the soak while
the PR is still open. If it is already merged, record a
post-merge follow-up, retain the source branch, and do not restart the merged
PR's soak. Stop only after the endpoint is reached and both audits have a disposition.
A post-merge follow-up with the source branch retained is a valid final
disposition.

## Final state

Verify the PR's final state.
