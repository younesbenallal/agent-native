# Writing Agent Instructions & Skills

This is a creator-facing guide. When you build an agent-native app or template,
the agent's behavior is only as good as the instructions you give it. Three
surfaces carry that guidance: `AGENTS.md` (the map), skills (the deep dives),
and action/tool descriptions (how the agent picks the right tool). Write each
one for fast retrieval, not for prose.

## Keep AGENTS.md small and skimmable

`AGENTS.md` is loaded as orientation. It should be the smallest thing that lets
the agent act correctly, with everything deep pushed into skills. Aim for these
sections and little else:

- **Purpose line** — one sentence on what the app is and the primary workflow.
- **Core rules** — the handful of invariants that must always hold (data in SQL,
  operations go through actions, AI goes through the agent chat, schema changes
  are additive). Short, imperative bullets.
- **Application-state keys** — the `navigation`/selection/focus keys the agent
  reads to know what the user is looking at, with their shape.
- **Action table** — a compact table of action name -> purpose (see below).
- **Skills index** — a list of the skills that exist and when to read each one.

If a section is growing past a screen, it belongs in a skill. `AGENTS.md`
answers "what is this app and what can I do," not "how exactly do I do the hard
thing."

### The 6,000-character cap is real and silent

A template `AGENTS.md` is injected into the runtime agent's system prompt and
hard-sliced at `COMPACT_PROMPT_RESOURCE_MAX_CHARS` (6,000). Past that, the agent
sees a truncation marker instead of your text, so the tail stops being
always-on guidance and becomes something it has to go fetch. `pnpm
guard:agent-chat-context` — the repository's own check — fails the build when a
first-party file overflows; generated apps do not ship that repository-only
guard. Keep files under ~5,500 so ordinary edits don't tip them over.

Two consequences worth designing around:

- **Put the skills list second, right after the purpose line.** It is the
  pointer to every deferred skill. If it lands in the truncated tail, the agent
  cannot discover any of the depth you carefully moved out.
- **Markdown tables cost more than they look.** Prettier pads table cells to
  align columns, and that invisible whitespace counts against the cap — enough
  padding in a wide action table to push a file back over it on its own. Both
  `**/AGENTS.md` and `**/SKILL.md` are in `.prettierignore` for this reason;
  keep them there and write table rows unpadded.

# Projects App

One workspace for projects, tasks, and notes. Agent and UI share the same SQL
data and the same actions.

## Core Rules

- Data lives in SQL via Drizzle. Use actions for all writes.
- All AI work goes through the agent chat; never call an LLM inline.
- Schema changes are additive only.

## Application State

- `navigation.view`: `home` | `project`
- `navigation.projectId`: selected project on a project page

## Actions

| Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `list-projects` | List accessible projects |
| `create-project` | Create a project |
| `update-project` | Rename or archive a project |

## Skills

- `project-imports` — read before importing legacy CSV exports.
- `sharing` — read before exposing a project to other users.
```

## Single-source AGENTS.md (CLAUDE.md is a symlink)

Keep one canonical instructions file: `AGENTS.md`. If a client expects
`CLAUDE.md`, make it a symlink to `AGENTS.md` rather than a second copy. Two
hand-maintained files drift, and the agent ends up with contradictory rules.
One source of truth, linked where needed.

## Keep generated guidance in sync

Framework guidance is authored once in this repo and copied outward. Treat
`.agents/skills/` as the canonical source for shared skills. Generated
workspace skills in `packages/core/src/templates/workspace-core/.agents/skills/`
and first-party template copies of shared skills must stay byte-for-byte in
sync; run `pnpm sync:workspace-skills` after editing a shared skill, and
`pnpm guard:workspace-skills` before calling the guidance done.

Generated app and workspace instructions must teach the same action-first data
contract:

- Normal app data goes through `defineAction` files in `actions/`.
- React calls actions with `useActionQuery`, `useActionMutation`, or
  `callAction`; route paths are a transport detail hidden behind helpers.
- Custom `/api/*` routes are only for route-shaped protocols such as uploads,
  streaming, webhooks, OAuth callbacks, public SEO/OG endpoints, or binary
  assets.
- Do not create pass-through routes whose main job is to call, repackage, or
  re-export an action.
- For external MCP/WebMCP callers, point at the author rule and result
  contract in the `external-agents` skill (Rule section); do not paraphrase
  them per app.

Rules that must influence app generation or the runtime agent cannot live only
in `scope: dev` skills. Put the short invariant in the generated `AGENTS.md`
or another runtime-visible instruction surface, then keep the implementation
details in the relevant skill.

Generated guidance must also distinguish deterministic tools from AI-shaped
workflows. Provider reads, validation, deterministic transforms, CRUD, and
persistence belong in focused actions. Research, analysis, generation,
recommendation, synthesis, and other user-steerable multi-step work should
start in the AgentSidebar and let the agent orchestrate those actions. State
that `sendToAgentChat({ openSidebar: true })` is the default handoff and that
follow-ups stay in the same thread; do not add a second freeform prompt box.

## Budget the first model request

Treat the initial prompt and tool catalog as a latency budget. The agent should
start with a compact map of the app, then retrieve depth only when the task
needs it.

- Set `initialToolNames` to the small set of actions used in the app's primary
  workflows. Keep `tool-search` available so every other registered action and
  connected MCP tool remains discoverable on demand. This list is also what
  MCP `instructions` and the WebMCP manifest advertise as the app's key tools,
  so keep it equal to the `AGENTS.md` action table — see the `actions` skill,
  Key Actions.
- Keep essential, always-applicable rules in `AGENTS.md`. Put workflow detail
  in skills and long reference material in `references/` or workspace
  resources that the agent can read when relevant.
- Do not inject full documents, transcripts, data dictionaries, source trees,
  or provider catalogs through `systemPrompt` or `extraContext`. Inject a
  bounded summary, stable ids/paths, and the exact action or resource lookup
  that retrieves the full content.
- Avoid duplicating action descriptions in prose. The starter tools already
  carry schemas; uncommon actions are available through `tool-search`.
- Keep `view-screen` concise. Return navigation, selection, visible summary,
  and ids needed for a follow-up read rather than full record bodies.

The goal is progressive disclosure, not reduced capability: a compact first
request, precise discovery, and full fidelity once the agent knows which depth
is relevant.

## Say each thing once, in the layer that owns it

Current-generation models do not need a rule repeated in the system prompt, the
instructions, and the tool description. Repetition is not reinforcement — it is
three chances to disagree with each other, and the model spends effort
reconciling them before it can act. Pick the owning layer:

| Layer | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| System prompt / `AGENTS.md` | Which capabilities exist, and policy spanning tools: turn shape, what to do first, invariants that hold every turn |
| Tool / action description | How to call it, argument and result semantics, what to say about a result, when this tool rather than a sibling |
| Skill | Multi-step workflows, worked examples, field references, edge cases |

The common mistake is restating a tool's mechanics as a numbered core rule.
Deferred tools are loaded through `tool-search`, so the model always reads the
description before it can call the tool — a start/update/complete sequence or an
argument enum in the prompt buys nothing and is charged on every turn. State
that the capability exists and when it applies; let the description carry how.

## Prefer judgment over rules, and interfaces over examples

Blanket prohibitions were how older models were kept out of worst-case
behavior. They now mostly cost accuracy, because a rule stated absolutely is
wrong for some fraction of requests and the model has to guess which fraction it
is in. Write the intent and let the model apply it:

- Say "match the surrounding code's comment density" rather than "never write
  comments." Say "response length mirrors the task" rather than "2–5 sentences."
- Skip arbitrary numeric formatting prescriptions (bullet counts, nesting bans)
  unless a surface genuinely breaks without them.
- Keep hard constraints for the areas where a wrong call is expensive and not
  self-correcting: security, destructive operations, fabricating data or
  success, and credential handling. Those stay absolute.
- Don't add few-shot examples of tool calls to teach usage. Examples narrow the
  model to the shapes you showed. Make the tool's own interface expressive
  instead — precise parameter names, enums that imply the state machine,
  `.describe()` on every field. Keep a literal example only where it defines a
  syntax the schema cannot, such as a `pnpm action` CLI invocation in dev mode.

When documenting version history, restore, or audit trails, use actions for
full restorable snapshots (`list-<resource>-versions`,
`get-<resource>-version`, `restore-<resource>-version`,
`delete-<resource>-version`). Do not copy legacy raw-route version panels,
such as document-version `/api/*` helpers, into new features. The Plans
version-history pattern is the preferred model.

## SKILL.md frontmatter must say what AND when

The `description` is the only thing the agent sees when deciding whether to read
a skill. It must answer two questions: what the skill covers, and when to
trigger it. A description that only describes the topic will not fire.

```markdown
---
name: project-imports
description: >-
  How to import projects from the legacy CSV export. Use when the user uploads
  a project CSV or asks to migrate projects from the old system.
---
```

- Lead with the capability, then add an explicit **"Use when…"** clause.
- Be slightly pushy — over-triggering beats a skill that never loads.
- Keep it under ~40 words; it is loaded into context on every conversation.

### Scope a skill to runtime vs dev

An optional `scope` field decides which agent loads the skill:

- `both` (default when omitted) — loaded by connected repo agents and the
  in-app runtime agent.
- `runtime` — loaded only by the in-app runtime agent.
- `dev` — for the human's coding agent (e.g. Claude Code) only. A `scope: dev`
  skill is invisible to the runtime agent everywhere (system-prompt skills block
  and `docs-search`).

Use `scope: dev` for internal-only guidance that should help connected repo
agents such as Codex or Claude Code, but should not influence the deployed
production agent. Do not use `metadata.internal` for this: it is catalog/package
metadata and does not control runtime visibility.

```markdown
---
name: release-checklist
description: >-
  Steps for cutting a release. Use when preparing or publishing a new version.
scope: dev
---
```

Omit `scope` for normal skills (the default `both` keeps them loading at
runtime — fully backward compatible). For a dev-only skill, mark it `scope: dev`
and optionally mirror it under `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` so Claude Code
picks it up while the runtime agent skips it.

## Progressive disclosure: lean SKILL.md, depth in references/

Write the SKILL.md as the lean, must-know layer: the rule, how to do it, the
do/don't list, and pointers. Push long examples, exhaustive field references,
API quirks, and edge-case tables into `references/` files the agent reads only
when it needs them.

```
.agents/skills/project-imports/
├── SKILL.md            # rule + happy path + do/don't
└── references/
    └── csv-format.md   # full column spec, encodings, edge cases
```

This keeps the always-loaded surface small and lets depth scale without bloating
context. See the **create-skill** skill for the full skill format.

## Write action-oriented tables

The agent scans tables faster than prose. Prefer a table of name -> purpose over
paragraphs describing each operation. The same applies to state keys, field
types, and any enumerable set. Tables are skimmable, diffable, and easy to keep
in sync when you add an action.

## Write clear tool/action descriptions

Action descriptions are tool descriptions — they drive tool selection. Make each
one a precise, single-purpose sentence:

- Say what it does and what it returns, not how it's implemented.
- Describe each parameter in its `.describe()` so the agent fills it correctly.
- One responsibility per action. If a description needs "and also…", split it.
- Mark read-only actions (`readOnly: true` / `http: { method: "GET" }`) so the
  agent knows they're safe to call freely.
- For provider-backed shortcuts, make clear they are convenience paths, not
  capability ceilings. If arbitrary provider endpoints/filters may matter,
  point instructions to `provider-api-catalog`, `provider-api-docs`, and
  `provider-api-request` instead of implying the shortcut is all the agent can
  do.

```ts
defineAction({
  description: "Create a project. Returns the new project id and title.",
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string().min(1).describe("Project title shown in the sidebar"),
  }),
  // ...
});
```

## Bake in anti-fabrication and verify-before-done

App instructions should make honesty and verification the default behavior:

- **Never fabricate.** If data isn't found or an action fails, say so and recover
  — don't invent results or claim success. Read the real value via an action or
  query before reporting it.
- **Verify before declaring done.** After a change, confirm it with a read-back
  (re-query the row, re-read the screen via `view-screen`) instead of assuming
  the write worked.
- **Recover, don't give up.** On a recoverable error (a failed query, a transient
  fetch), retry or fix the input rather than abandoning the task. Keep this
  separate from the anti-fabrication rule — don't conflate "don't make things up"
  with "stop at the first error."

Put these as core rules in `AGENTS.md` so they apply to every turn.

## Bake in secrets hygiene

Instruction authors must make credential handling explicit anywhere an app,
skill, action, webhook, integration, or extension touches external services.
Write the rule in terms of values, not just files: never hardcode real API keys,
tokens, webhook URLs, signing secrets, OAuth refresh tokens, private
Builder/internal data, or customer data in source, docs, tests, fixtures,
prompts, screenshots, or generated content.

Examples may name credential keys such as `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `SLACK_WEBHOOK`,
but values must be placeholders (`<OPENAI_API_KEY>`, `${keys.SLACK_WEBHOOK}`) or
clearly fake test data. Tell agents which approved channel to use instead:
deployment env vars for deploy-level secrets, `app_secrets` /
`saveCredential` / `resolveCredential` for scoped API keys, `oauth_tokens` for
OAuth, and `${keys.NAME}` substitution for extension/automation outbound HTTP.

## What goes where

- **AGENTS.md** — applies to the whole app, every turn: purpose, core rules,
  state keys, action index, skills index.
- **Skills** — reusable how-to for a specific pattern, loaded on demand. Applies
  to everyone working in the app.
- **Memory (`memory/MEMORY.md`)** — per-user preferences and corrections, not
  authored guidance. See **capture-learnings**.

## Do

- Keep `AGENTS.md` to roughly one screen of orientation; link out for depth.
- Update the action table and skills index whenever you add an action or skill.
- Write every SKILL.md description with an explicit "Use when…".
- Use tables for any enumerable set (actions, state keys, field types).

## Don't

- Don't duplicate skill content inside `AGENTS.md` — point to the skill.
- Don't maintain two instruction files; symlink `CLAUDE.md` to `AGENTS.md`.
- Don't write vague descriptions ("helps with projects") — they won't trigger.
- Don't document niche/buried UI behaviors in instructions; let code and UI
  carry those.
- Don't paste real credentials, credential-looking dummy strings, private
  Builder/internal data, or customer data into examples. Use placeholders.
