  How to add or edit localized UI copy in agent-native apps. Use when adding,
  removing, or changing user-visible interface text, prompts, toasts, labels,
  empty states, or date/number/list formatting. Apps opt in to additional
  locales from `agent-native.config.ts`.

# Internationalization — opt-in translations

English (`en-US`) is the default source locale. Do not create or update
additional locale catalogs unless the app's `agent-native.config.ts` lists them
under `translations.locales`.

## Rule

Visible framework/template UI copy belongs in the app's i18n catalog, not
inline in components. When you add or edit UI text, update the English source
catalog first, then update only the locale catalogs listed in
`translations.locales`, and run the i18n guard.

## Catalogs

Templates use `app/i18n/`:

- `en-US.ts` is the canonical source tree and fallback.
- Other locale files keep the same non-plural keys and the same placeholders.
- `index.ts` exports an `AgentNativeI18nCatalog` with English bundled and
  non-English catalogs loaded by dynamic import.

Use BCP-47 filenames from the supported set: `en-US`, `zh-CN`, `es-ES`,
`fr-FR`, `de-DE`, `ja-JP`, `ko-KR`, `pt-BR`, `hi-IN`, `ar-SA`.

If an app only ships translations for a subset of that set, set
`supportedLocales` on the `AgentNativeI18nCatalog` to that subset. Without it,
`<LanguagePicker />` lists every framework-supported locale regardless of
whether `loadMessages` can actually resolve it.

## UI Pattern

- Wrap apps with `AppProviders i18n={{ catalog: i18nCatalog }}`.
- Read strings with `useT()` and keep keys stable.
- Apps expose a `/settings` route without a sidebar item for it: Settings
  opens from the account menu in the sidebar footer and from ⌘, (Ctrl+,
  elsewhere). Put `<LanguagePicker />` in that settings page, usually in a
  Language or General section, and keep the header language icon only as a
  quick-access shortcut. With the `settings-redesign` flag on, core's
  Account › Preferences page already renders the Interface language row
  (with Timezone; both are the per-user `localization` record, so a change
  applies in every app); don't add a second picker to a redesigned page.
- Don't add an "Agent settings" row to an app's settings page: the Agent
  group's pages are part of Settings. Link to a page with
  `buildSettingsRoute(page, sub?)`, and localize the link's label.
- Settings copy follows the same rules: page and group labels are core
  `agentChat.settingsShell.*` keys, and an app's own rows, areas, and search
  entries take already translated strings from the app catalog.
- Use `useFormatters()` for dates, numbers, relative time, and lists instead
  of embedding formatted values in translation strings.
- Do not translate stable identifiers: action names, route names, enum values,
  app-state keys, database values, protocol fields, env var names, or provider
  names.

## Plurals And Placeholders

Plural strings use i18next/CLDR suffixes. Do not force every locale to copy
English plural categories:

- English uses `_one` and `_other`.
- Chinese and Japanese usually use `_other`.
- Arabic uses `_zero`, `_one`, `_two`, `_few`, `_many`, and `_other`.

Keep interpolation placeholders identical across locales, such as
`{{count}}`, `{{name}}`, or ICU-style `{count}` arguments.

## RTL

New UI should be RTL-safe. Prefer logical CSS utilities/properties such as
`ms-*`, `me-*`, `ps-*`, `pe-*`, `start-*`, `end-*`, `text-start`, and
`text-end` when direction matters. Avoid hardcoded left/right positioning for
new localized UI unless it is genuinely physical.

## Verification

Run:

```bash
pnpm guard:i18n-catalogs
```

For broader changes, also run the affected template tests and `pnpm typecheck`.
Machine translation is only a starting point; high-visibility strings need
human review.
