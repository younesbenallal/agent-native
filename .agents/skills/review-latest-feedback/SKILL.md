# Review Latest Feedback

Four phases, in order. Phase 0 comes before any investigation, not after.

0. **Claim** every item you intend to tackle with `👀`, before investigating
   any of it.
1. **Answer the people who answered you.** Older open questions first.
2. **Fix** what the evidence actually proves, at the owning boundary.
3. **Reply**, under a hard question budget, then recap.

Output is fixes; reply only when informative. Two fixes and three messages
beats thirty replies.

## Phase 0: claim what you are taking

`👀` is permanent claim history; add it before investigation and never remove
it. An eye without a terminal disposition is unresolved, not available to
another workflow. Check its thread and linked work; continue or coordinate
active work, and defer if ownership is unclear. Post **In progress** only when
work continues beyond this run.

**Defects are in scope: fix them or ask for the one detail needed to fix them.**
Investigate first; ask what they saw or did in plain language. Gather request
details and logs yourself; don't send reporters to developer tools.

The proposed remedy may be wrong while the bug is real. Trace the failure to
its owning boundary; do not reject it because the suggestion is unsuitable.

For a parent with multiple symptoms, record a disposition for each symptom
before claiming it. A subjective or out-of-scope suggestion does not close a
separate defect. Keep `👀` on the parent once claimed, and add `✅` only after
every actionable defect in that parent has a verified fix.

### Checkmark gate

`✅` is for verified **Fixed** only, after Phase 2's four bars. For a shared
fix, add it to every claimed report it resolves. **Shipped** and **Live
verified** alone do not qualify. Never remove reactions; newer evidence
controls status.

If no safe repo-owned fix is evident, record the evidence limit. Ask only a
question that could unblock a fix; after four days without an answer, record
**Abandoned - no answer in 4 days**.

Use **Skipped** only for non-defects, never breakage. **Open - no question**
means you found neither a fix nor a useful question; state why in the thread.

### Authoritative disposition vocabulary

Use one disposition per ledger row; keep its wording in the recap and thread or
linked work:

Record terminal disposition in the thread or linked work; if neither states
it, reply once. Current status comes from text or work, never the eye. For
clusters, use one owner status listing each source permalink and **Clustered**
state; reply in a non-owner only for a distinct question or update.

- **Terminal (keep this workflow's eye):** **Fixed**, **Shipped**, **Live
  verified**, **Open - no question**, **Resolved elsewhere**, **Skipped**,
  **Clustered**, or **Abandoned - no answer in 4 days**. Record an unstated
  terminal disposition in the thread or linked work; add `✅` only for verified
  fixes.
- **Active (retain 👀):** **Verified locally**, **Built - live unverified**,
  **Deployed - live unverified**, **Not reproducible - attempted**, or
  **In progress**.
- **Waiting on reporter (retain 👀):** **Asked**, **Clarification needed**, or
  **Blocked on reporter**. Find these through Phase 1's question search.
- **Foreign ownership:** **Owned elsewhere** only when the latest thread update
  or linked work confirms another active owner; an eye alone is claim history.

After source merge, **Fixed** is terminal; track publication, beta, and live
work separately. Link follow-ups with the original issue, target package/
release/runtime, owner, and verification command or URL. Do not rediscover or
reopen closed fixes through open-issue scans. **Clustered** closes one row but
retains it.

Enumerate `slack_read_channel` newest backward through `next_cursor` until a
parent is older than 5 days. Record the oldest in-range parent as the scan
boundary. Classify parent text, attachments, and reactions before opening
threads.

**`slack_search` can rank and truncate.** Use channel reads to enumerate parents
and put their count in the recap. Sort targeted searches oldest-first and follow
`next_cursor` until exhausted.

A channel read returns parents, so use its timestamps directly; *search* hits
are usually replies, so resolve those through the permalink `thread_ts` first.

Read back each `👀` once before investigation. Follow status for resumed work.

Claiming does not investigate. Search-discovered work gets the same eye-first
read-back. Do not claim items that are already
classified as out of scope. If an item is later found out of scope after being
claimed, keep `👀`, record **Skipped**, and post one concise status reply, no
question. New
evidence or a current `:upvote:` can restore scope after any non-fixed terminal
disposition; continue on the existing eye. Preserve foreign eyes. Confirm an
active owner from current thread status or linked work, not the eye alone.

Give each claim a disposition and recap row; reply only with informative
outcomes. Cluster fresh repeats for Phase 2.

### External trackers are evidence, not status

For a supplied spreadsheet, export, test matrix, or tracker, read metadata then
the bounded range with its named connector. Enumerate every row and its
completion status; retain its id, reporter, symptom, status, retest, and source
link.

Status, reactions, a merged PR, a source diff, or a unit test is not behavior
proof. Each row needs a post-change ledger result. If it cannot be read, say
**tracker unavailable**, never "no matches."

## Phase 1: answer the people who answered you

Every question you ask creates an obligation to come back for the answer.
Discharge it before reading anything new.

Slack is the ledger. Do not keep a local one — a per-run state file cannot
see the previous run, which is why the follow-up never happened. Run this
first, every time:

```
slack_search: "this was sent from a bot." in:<#CHANNEL>
  sort=timestamp sort_dir=asc include_context=true max_context_length=300
```

Keep `include_context=true` on every page and follow `next_cursor` until
exhausted. Its `Context after` block identifies human replies; do not filter to
replies ending in `?`. Open only threads with a human reply.

**The parent is the permalink's `thread_ts`.** `Message_ts` is your own
reply's timestamp; acting on it targets the wrong message.

Find new replies even when their parent is older than the five-day scan. Before
searching, read the `Reply scan cursor` from the previous recap; if absent,
scan all available history. Search all channel messages over an overlapping
date window, sorted oldest-first, and filter hits to timestamps after that
cursor. Resolve each hit to its parent's `thread_ts` and read the full thread.
Slack's `after:` takes a date, not a message timestamp; start at least one day
before the cursor date. Follow `next_cursor` until exhausted. Record the last
processed timestamp only after every page is handled.

An item is answered only when a person speaks after the question without this
workflow's disclosure marker. Open the thread: a partial, unrelated, or
"will check later" reply is not sufficient. Count a reply once; only a newer
message re-enters the set. Enumerate answered threads before new work and put
the count in the recap. Keep unanswered **Clarification needed** threads
pending until answered, resolved, or aged out at four days; **Fixed**,
**Shipped**, **In progress**, and **Open - no question** are not substitutes.
Reapply the Phase 0 eye and checkmark rules to terminal states.

Only an unanswered **Clarification needed** thread enters the age branches
below. If an older thread was marked **Open - no question** despite one, restore it
to pending.

- **Someone answered** → highest priority in the run, ahead of every newer
  report: the evidence you said blocked you now exists. Rebuild it and attempt
  the fix. Reply **Fixed** only after all four bars pass; otherwise keep the
  clarification open. Never ask a follow-up before trying the fix.
  An answer that the issue is already resolved, fixed elsewhere, or not ours —
  a linked PR, "not a Clips issue" — is still an answer. Close it as
  **Resolved elsewhere** (terminal, and distinct from **Skipped**, which means
  out of scope): keep our `👀` and record who resolved it and where. The
  participant's reply is the status; do not add `✅`.
- **No answer, posted under 4 days ago** → leave it. Post nothing. A second
  message is a nag, not a follow-up.
- **No answer, posted over 4 days ago** → the question failed. Do not remind or
  re-ask. Keep the `👀`, record **Abandoned - no answer in 4 days** once in the
  thread without a new question, and carry any still-relevant bug forward as an
  internal investigation.

Search without an `after` filter, then apply the four-day expiry; disclosure is
the primary cross-identity cursor. For legacy replies
without disclosure or eyes, run this once per valid workflow identity:

```
slack_search: from:<EACH_WORKFLOW_IDENTITY> in:<#CHANNEL>
  sort=timestamp sort_dir=asc
```

Classify those hits by clarification wording such as `if you can share`, not as
the discovery cursor. Inspect author and full thread so another identity finds
the same question; never re-ask either search's result. Search for the
disclosure string, not a display name, and never omit it from a reply.

## Classification rules

Phase 0 applies these from parent-level evidence to decide what to claim.
Phase 2 reapplies these rules after full-thread review.

Use the workspace's product feedback channel; here that is
`#product-agent-native-feedback` (`C0ATH3CCZT4`) unless the invocation names
another.

**Defects and design feedback.** A clear bug has observable broken behavior: a
click or submit does nothing, an action errors, data is lost or reverted, the
result is wrong, or a working flow regressed. A credible "nothing happens" is
valid evidence — inspect the owning path before doubting the reporter.

Do not change code for an unrelated product idea, praise, status update, merge
or review request, bot forward, duplicate, or work outside the invocation's
ownership.

**Keep subjective UI changes human-in-the-loop.** Automatically fix only
objective UI defects: broken interactions, misalignment, overlap or clipping,
unusable controls, or removing clear excess clutter. A reporter request is not
product signoff. Discoverability complaints and preferences do not authorize
adding, promoting, moving, or duplicating buttons or other persistent chrome.
Check overflow, keyboard, Cmd+K, and contextual surfaces first. Adding or
promoting chrome requires the invoking user's explicit current-task request or
  :upvote:` below. Otherwise mark **Skipped**. If already claimed, keep our `👀`
  and post **Skipped** once if the thread does not state it; do not ask the
  reporter to decide. Measure failures with `text-heavy-ui`.

Requests for a new capability still follow the invoking identity's `:upvote:`
gate. Content remains Alice's area unless the invocation claims it.

### `:upvote:` authorizes feature requests

An `:upvote:` from **the invoking identity** - not from anyone else - promotes
an otherwise out-of-scope item into scope and authorizes the work. It is the
endorsement that settles the product question: the person who would otherwise
route this away has read it and decided it should happen. Build it.

Find them alongside the newest-message scan:

```
slack_search: hasmy::upvote: in:<#CHANNEL>
```

`hasmy:` is already scoped to the connected identity you verified, so every
hit is an endorsement by definition. Hits are not self-evidently in scope —
the query also returns ordinary replies and old polls that happen to carry the
reaction. Take the ones that name a concrete improvement; skip the rest
without comment.

An upvoted item is a **feature or UX change**: it skips only the clear-bug bar,
not `👀`, fix-altitude, verification, or question-budget requirements. The
upvote overrides the bug gate, not ownership; build the smallest endorsed
version and name Sid or Alice in the recap. Add `👀` before investigation or
delegation and read it back. Keep an evidence-limited disposition until Phase
2's four bars hold; then use **Shipped**, adding `✅` only if it also meets
**Fixed**.

Every run, exhaust oldest-first `has::eyes:` pages. Revisit active/waiting
claims at any age, even without replies; terminal claims reopen on new evidence:

```
slack_search: has::eyes: in:<#CHANNEL>
  sort=timestamp sort_dir=asc
```

Read each full thread and linked work before classifying its current status;
use reaction metadata only as history. Mark **Owned elsewhere** only when
thread status or linked work confirms an active owner. New evidence after
terminal status reopens the report; keep reactions.

For GitHub, Sentry, and first-party Agent-Native Analytics, use native state as
the cursor: recent open or unresolved items with no maintainer disposition,
deduplicated against Slack. If a source cannot be read, record it as
**unavailable**. Never report "nothing matched" for a source you could not
query.

### GitHub issues, Sentry, and Agent-Native Analytics are first-class feedback

Read each issue's body, comments, author, labels, linked PRs. Treat
prior `fixed`, `shipped`, or `merged` comments as leads; recheck the surface.
When a fix merges, thank the reporter, link it, and close. Track release/runtime
gaps separately; keep open only while scope is unfixed, unmerged, or needs input.

Before claiming an issue, check comments for handoffs. If someone offers a PR,
or Steve asks them to, mark **Owned elsewhere**; do not investigate, edit, test,
ship, reply, or close it. A direct request overrides this.

Fix every defect at its root or ask an unblock question; do not
skip old, bot-filed, or maintainer-commented issues. Feature requests and
subjective feedback need user/`:upvote:` authorization. Ask three questions max;
re-read before posting/closing.

Query both production Sentry projects - frontend/browser and backend/CLI -
paginate unresolved issues, and record representative events, releases, and
fingerprints. Classify each as repo-owned, external/provider,
deployment/configuration, or unclear; fix repo-owned failures at the boundary
and verify the source/build. Check the published runtime when available, but
record any release or live gap separately rather than holding a merged fix open.
Record external actions for the rest; silence or an old release is not proof the
current error is gone.

Query authenticated Agent-Native Analytics error issues in parallel. Use
`list-error-issues` for unresolved groups, then `get-error-issue` for stacks,
occurrences, breadcrumbs, tags, and replay links. It captures client exceptions
and server `captureError()` failures when the server Analytics key/provider is
configured. Use it as the Sentry fallback when rate-limited. Do not query
`error_issues` or `error_events` through
`query-agent-native-analytics`; use that action only for bounded event/LLM
correlation. Apply the same ownership gate: fix worthwhile repo-owned issues
at their boundary, verify runtime, and record external, deployment, or unclear
issues without inventing a fix.

## Phase 2: fix

Before changing code, read `fix-at-the-boundary`, `verifying-changes`, and
`concurrent-agents`. Read `ship` when a verified fix is ready to publish.

**Read the evidence the reporter already attached before forming a hypothesis.**
Open every screenshot, clip, and linked artifact. The error text in a
screenshot is usually the whole diagnosis. Track an artifact that is
permission-gated or expired separately from one that was never provided —
inaccessible is not absent.

**Sweep siblings before you claim anything is fixed.** Derive the fingerprint
from the symptom, not the file — the exact crashing token, call shape, or
literal — then search the repo for it and enumerate every hit in your recap
before editing. `fix-at-the-boundary` owns the method. A fix that repairs the
reported route and leaves the identical crash in its sibling is not a fix, and
the reporter was told otherwise.

### Repeats get more time, not the same fix again

Before fixing anything, search the channel for prior reports of the same
symptom:

```
slack_search: <2-4 distinctive symptom words> in:<#CHANNEL>
  sort=timestamp sort_dir=desc
```

Search in the reporter's words — `zoom invalid_client`, `logout twice` — not
your diagnosis. People describe one bug differently, so read the hits rather
than trusting the count.

**A repeat report after a Fixed claim is evidence that fix failed.** It is the
only falsification signal this workflow gets, and it outranks your belief that
the code is correct. Treat it as a stop, not a fresh report:

1. **Find what we said last time** — the prior thread, its **Fixed** reply,
   and the commit behind it. You want the claim that turned out wrong.
2. **Name why it did not take**: never deployed; fixed a sibling path; root
   cause misdiagnosed; or one symptom of several. Each needs a different
   repair, and re-applying the same class of change is how one bug ships
   three times.
3. **Reproduce end to end before editing, verify end to end after.** A passing
   unit test is not sufficient for a repeat — exercise the surface the reporter
   used. `verifying-changes` owns the proof.
4. **Cluster identical causes** into one investigation and fix, but keep a
   recap row per source thread; Phase 3's reply rules still apply.

Record `Repeat of: <link>` and the prior failed fix in each row; never call a
repeat fixed on the evidence that supported the earlier claim.

Measure this gate with friction keys `false-done` and
`repeat-report-refix`. Run `node scripts/agent-friction-report.mjs --weeks 2
--pattern <key>` for each before changing it and again later. A climbing count
requires a mechanical proof or release gate, not more prose.

### Bug-bash reproduction contract

For Design, Slides, Core/framework, and template bashes, the reachable reported
surface is the contract:

1. **Reproduce before editing.** Use the exact URL/route, app/template,
   account/workspace/role, build/package, browser/device, fixture, and inputs;
   record expected/actual, errors, and attached artifacts.
2. **Sweep siblings and boundaries.** Test a negative control plus empty, wrong,
   whitespace, case, and permission variants; enumerate every shared fingerprint.
3. **Repeat on the changed running artifact.** Rerun the flow, refresh/navigate,
   read UI and persisted state, and cover failure/retry/cancel/async paths.
   Destructive flows require wrong/partial/exact confirmation and recovery;
   do not delete unless needed.
4. **Test release and race layers.** Use deterministic concurrency or 10 runs,
   a clean scaffold/cache and exact published/candidate package, and the exact
   beta/production URL when those layers are in scope. These strengthen
   **Shipped** and **Live verified**; they do not keep a verified, merged source
   fix open.
5. Record untested layers/variants. Before a verified merge, use the narrowest
   evidence-limited disposition. Once the source fix is verified in the merged
   shipping snapshot, use **Fixed** even when publication, beta, or live layers
   remain; create or link the durable follow-up required above. Use **Shipped**
   or **Live verified** only after their additional bars hold. Never release
   `✅` or call **Fixed** without merged source proof. A post-checkmark repeat
   reopens the item and needs a fresh failing pre-change reproduction.

### Reproduction ledger - required for every row

For each row, record symptom/surface, reproduction steps and account, expected
and pre/post behavior, tested commit/build, sibling results, untested layers,
and runtime layer (`local`, `source-only`, `built`, `deployed`, `observed-live`).

Without merged source proof, use an active or waiting disposition above. After
merge, **Fixed** may coexist with release follow-up; **Live verified** requires
all four bars. Status labels, reactions, and tests alone do not prove closure.
Repeats require a new pre-change failure and link the earlier false claim.

Regression claims require Red/Green proof: reverse-apply hunk with
`git apply -R`, record failure, reapply, record pass. Repeat timing checks 10x.
If output missing, build it and rerun on `origin/main` before calling them
pre-existing.

### Npx and package reports have a release follow-up

Npx scaffolds are versioned. Record pinned/filed versions, fresh npm cache/no
local override, candidate result, release, and existing-app path (`pnpm add
@agent-native/core@<version>` or hand edit).

Local proof, beta promises, and scaffolds are not **Shipped**/**Live verified**
until published. A verified merged fix is **Fixed** and closes the issue. Record
merge commit, release, verification, and bump/re-scaffold follow-up. Unknown
package/endpoint context is a release follow-up. Ask only if source scope or
reporter input is unclear; missing evidence does not keep a merged fix open.
Merge/beta is not npx delivery.

### Documentation has a runnable proof obligation

For each docs row, copy commands into a clean temporary scaffold; verify every
referenced file, directory, script, env var, deploy target, link, and fence
order. A docs diff/build is not enough. Update configured locales and run
`guard:i18n-catalogs` plus `guard:i18n-changed-copy`.

Choose the narrowest seam the evidence supports:

- One isolated symptom → fix the owning local seam, add a regression check.
- Repeated or cross-surface symptoms → fix the shared primitive or contract.
- Missing capability or wrong tool → fix discovery, registry, or action wiring.
- Source-versus-live mismatch → diagnose build, deployment, or release state
  before changing source.

Never hard-code a rule for the wording of one report. One data point justifies
a local regression test or a contained fix; it never justifies a global agent
instruction or prompt exception.

### The bar for saying "Fixed"

Say **Fixed** only when all four hold: named symptom; exact pre/post
reproduction; clean or triaged sibling sweep; and verified change in the merged
shipping snapshot with source or built layer named. **Shipped** adds
build/deploy provenance; **Live verified** adds target-runtime proof. Otherwise
use a narrower disposition without implying beta or production health. Upvoted
improvements state requested versus actual behavior and use **Shipped**.

## Phase 3: reply

Start GitHub issue comments by thanking the reporter for opening the issue;
start Slack feedback replies by thanking them for sharing the issue. Then give
the status or ask a question. Follow `address-feedback-with-replies` for the
remaining Slack reply voice and wording. Every reply ends with
`this was sent from a bot.` after the plain-language status.

Reply with a new status or useful information; do not repeat a status already
in the thread.

- **Fixed** / **Shipped** / **Live verified** - meet the applicable bars above.
  A live-verified row may be silent if its observation is recorded. For
  packages, name the published version when available; otherwise name the
  merged fix and list publication plus the upgrade/re-scaffold follow-up without
  claiming the published package is fixed. Name beta URL/runtime only when
  exercised; never substitute a future beta promise for release or live proof.
  Use **Shipped** for upvoted improvements.
- **In progress** — name the active work when it will continue beyond this run;
  acknowledge existing concrete ownership. Ask nothing.
- **A question** — subject to the budget below.

Unclaimed scope and noise get only an internal recap row. An unverified defect
earns a targeted question when one answer would unblock it; otherwise record
**Open - no question** once in the thread. Keep our eye and do not add `✅` for
this terminal disposition. Cluster duplicate causes.
Re-read the full thread before replying and stay out of active human work.

### The question budget

**At most three questions per run, across all sources.** Most runs ask zero or
one.

So rank before you ask. For each candidate, state: *if I get this answer, I
can ship the fix.* Ask the three with the strongest answer. If fewer than
three clear that bar, ask fewer. Everything below the cut is an internal open
item, not a message.

Never ask for supplied/inspectable evidence, irrelevant IDs/build numbers,
subjective choices, or internal blockers. If a user-visible link or ID is the
sole blocker, ask plainly and say where to find it.

At most one clarification question may be pending per thread at a time. Once it
is answered or resolved, attempt the fix; if that exposes a different required
detail, ask at most one new, non-repeating question. Never stack questions or
repeat a pending one. If a needed artifact is inaccessible to you, ask for a
fresh link - not for its contents again.

## Verification and identity

Follow the `## Slack identity` contract in `address-feedback-with-replies`:
confirm the connected profile is the invoking user before the first write, and
keep that identity for every read, reaction, reply, and read-back.

Resolve the Slack, GitHub, Sentry, and first-party Analytics error action
schemas once and reuse them.

For every Slack write: use the exact parent `thread_ts` from a full-thread
read, never a search-result or adjacent timestamp, and re-read after posting.
Do not close, label, assign, or comment on GitHub or Sentry unless the
invocation authorizes it; link them in the recap instead.

## Publishing

Use this worktree's branch. Batch fixes with one
`corepack pnpm ship:push -m "<specific fix>"`; each head reruns CI. Sync
`origin/main` only for GitHub conflicts; prefer normal merges on shared
branches. Behind/pending never justify syncing.

With shipping authority — an explicit request, or a caller that already
granted it — continue straight into `ship` in the same worktree without asking
again. Without it, prepare the ready-to-ship handoff and say shipping is
pending authorization. Carry the start cursor, grouped reports, evidence
links, owning seam, sibling-sweep results, and every disposition into the PR
body. Keep source-tested, built, deployed, and observed-live claims separate.

If a tracker was supplied, carry its exact row ids and the reproduction ledger
into the PR or release recap. Never turn a tracker status into a shipping claim.
Give every row its own disposition marker. A single reaction, checkmark, or
"reviewed" marker must not stand in for several rows, including expected,
docs-owned, cross-team, or duplicate items. Any source/docs change is linked
to its exact PR or commit; non-coding dispositions link the evidence or named
owner instead of borrowing a nearby PR link.

If the sweep found no verified fix, finish with the recap and say why no ship
started. Unavailable connectors and external failures are not shipping blockers.
While waiting, **Clarification needed** stays open with `👀` and no `✅`. It
must not block merging independently verified fixes unless the report could
affect a PR change. Keep the eye when new evidence arrives.

## Recap

Every item inspected gets a row, including ones you deliberately stayed silent
on - that is how silence stays auditable.

```md
## Feedback sweep
Start cursor: [Slack message](...)
Reply scan cursor (read from prior recap; use next run): <last timestamp fully processed>

```

`Open - no question` is a last resort, not a success state. It requires that
you worked the defect, could not fix it, and could not form a question that would
unblock it; a run whose ledger is mostly `Open - no question` has under-asked, not
finished. It keeps our eye and has no checkmark. "Nothing
matched" is valid only after each source was queried successfully, with the
cursor stated.
