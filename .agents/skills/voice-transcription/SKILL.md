# Voice Transcription

The microphone inside the sidebar composer offers two distinct paths:
editable dictation and an opt-in realtime speech-to-speech agent session.
Users configure dictation separately from AI cleanup in Settings → Voice
Transcription. With the `settings-redesign` flag on, the source picker (Mac
Native, Google Realtime, Batch) is the Voice transcription row on Settings ›
Account › Preferences (`VoiceTranscriptionSection compact`, anchor `voice`);
cleanup and batch provider keys stay in the agent sidebar's Voice
Transcription section. Both write the per-user `voice-transcription-prefs`
application state. Both paths are available in every template that renders
the shared agent sidebar.

## UX rules

- **Always show the mic alongside the send button.** Cursor replaces send
  with mic when the composer is empty; their users complain. We keep both
  visible — Lovable does the same.
- **Ask before switching modes.** The mic opens a compact shadcn popover with
  **Real-time voice** as the primary action and **Dictate** as the secondary;
  never silently replace the established dictation behavior. Users can choose
  **Remember my preference** to skip the chooser on later clicks.
- **Dictation is click-to-toggle, not push-to-talk.** More forgiving in a sidebar, avoids
  host-app hotkey clashes. Keyboard shortcut is `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+M` and
  `Escape` cancels mid-recording.
- **Transcript lands in the composer, editable, never auto-sent.** Insert at
  the caret via `editor.chain().focus().insertContent(text).run()`.
- **No CSS transitions for the recording state.** Framework rule; use static
  brand color (`#625DF5`) instead of pulses.
- **Icon:** Tabler `IconMicrophone` (idle) / `IconPlayerStopFilled` (recording).
  Never use a sparkle or robot icon.
- **Errors via inline alert or toast, never `window.alert`.**

## Realtime speech mode

Realtime speech mode is a full-duplex OpenAI Realtime WebRTC session, separate
from the dictation providers below. It prefers the authenticated user's
complete Builder connection and the Builder-managed metered gateway. A scoped
`OPENAI_API_KEY` is the fallback when Builder is not connected. The server owns
the `gpt-realtime-2.1` session configuration and keeps credentials out of
browser code. If neither provider is configured, show **Connect Builder** as
the primary microphone-popover action and OpenAI key setup as the secondary
action before requesting microphone permission.

- Starting voice mode collapses the chat into a persistent bottom-end speech
  orb. The orb stays visible above the chat even when the chat opens
  automatically. Clicking it shows or hides chat without ending the session;
  opening chat slides the orb clear of the sidebar. The progressively disclosed
  controls contain only settings and the separate end-session action.
- The orb's compact waveform stays visible for the full session and reflects
  actual microphone or assistant audio activity. At silence it rests at its
  baseline instead of turning into a loading spinner. Once connected, a soft,
  slowly rotating blue glow marks the live session; brighten and speed up the
  glow while the agent is working, and keep it static under reduced motion.
  While connecting, show a distinct compact spinner; when the session becomes
  live, the assistant gives one brief spoken greeting so readiness is
  unambiguous. Do not apply a text-sized `max_output_tokens` cap to that audio
  greeting because audio tokens can truncate it mid-sentence.
- The orb settings cog opens in place without ending voice mode or navigating
  away. Nested pickers must not dismiss the settings popover. Language and
  intelligence update the active Realtime session; the microphone picker swaps
  the live WebRTC input track and remembers the browser-local device choice;
  an output-voice change updates immediately only before the assistant has
  emitted audio and otherwise applies to the next conversation, matching the
  Realtime API's voice immutability rule.
- Semantic VAD keeps listening, starts responses automatically, and supports
  barge-in while the agent is speaking.
- Function calls must cross the authenticated realtime tool bridge and enter
  `executeAgentToolCall`. Never call `ActionEntry.run` directly: that bypasses
  schema validation, approvals, audit/journal behavior, timeouts, redaction,
  and mutation refreshes.
- Preserve the active browser-tab id in request context so `set-url-path`,
  `set-search-params`, `view-screen`, and tab-scoped application state affect
  the app the user is actually speaking to. Realtime tool manifests are capped,
  so prioritize `navigate`, `set-url-path`, `set-search-params`, and
  `view-screen` before packing large template registries.
- Keep `tool-search` in the initial Realtime manifest. A successful specific
  search may expand the live session with matching action schemas, but the
  server must derive those schemas from its own registry, bind authorization
  to the authenticated voice session, and continue execution through
  `executeAgentToolCall`. Treat `session.update.tools` as a full replacement:
  preserve the pinned navigation/discovery tools, evict lower-priority entries
  within the manifest cap, and wait for `session.updated` before asking the
  model to continue with a newly discovered tool.
- Do not persist audio or interim transcript deltas. Append completed user and
  assistant utterances as ordinary text messages to the exact chat thread
  captured when the session starts. Input transcription completes
  asynchronously from assistant generation, so reserve provider conversation
  item order and publish only the contiguous completed sequence; never use
  completion arrival time as chat order. Ending voice mode opens that chat so
  the user can continue over text. Store only compact lifecycle and latest
  context at `application_state["realtime-voice-session"]`; delete it when the
  session ends.
- Store the user-controlled language, intelligence, and output-voice choices at
  `application_state["realtime-voice-prefs"]`. Keep this separate from
  `voice-transcription-prefs`, which configures editable dictation rather than
  the speech-to-speech session.
- Store the optional remembered chooser selection at
  `application_state["voice-input-preference"]`. Keep it separate from both
  mode-specific preference objects.
- Missing-key failures should open Settings focused on the user-scoped
  `OPENAI_API_KEY` field. Never send, log, or echo the key to the browser.

## Source And Cleanup

Settings must keep these as separate choices:

- **Live transcription source**: `mac-native`, `google-realtime`, or `batch`.
- **AI cleanup**: independent off/on toggle. Cleanup uses managed Gemini first
  when a managed AI services connection is configured, then BYOK Gemini (the one
  Gemini key, `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`; older `GEMINI_API_KEY` rows still work).
  Gemini cleanup/title/summary generation is not a live STT source.

`application_state["voice-transcription-prefs"]` stores
`{ transcriptionMode, provider, instructions }`. The legacy `provider` field
is still written for old clients and batch provider preferences:

| Value             | Meaning                                                        | Needs key                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `mac-native`      | Native macOS/Tauri speech path; web clients normalize to browser-native where needed | No                           |
| `google-realtime` | Dedicated WebSocket → Google Speech-to-Text gRPC `StreamingRecognize` path | `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` |
| `batch`           | Upload audio after stop through the existing batch route       | Builder/Gemini/Groq/OpenAI depending on fallback |
| `auto` provider   | Browser SpeechRecognition when supported; server batch fallback chain otherwise | No key needed in browsers that support SpeechRecognition |
| `builder-gemini`  | Managed Gemini Flash-Lite batch/cleanup preference             | Managed AI services account connected |
| `gemini`          | Direct Google Gemini BYOK batch/cleanup preference             | `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` (or legacy `GEMINI_API_KEY`) |
| `groq`            | Groq Whisper batch preference                                  | `GROQ_API_KEY`               |
| `openai`          | OpenAI Whisper batch preference                                | `OPENAI_API_KEY`             |
| `browser`         | Legacy native/browser live speech preference                   | No                           |

Default behavior:

- The shared web settings/composer default to Batch / `auto`. In `auto` mode,
  `useVoiceDictation` uses `startBrowser()` (Web Speech API, no key required,
  incremental streaming) when the browser supports `SpeechRecognition`. It only
  falls back to the MediaRecorder → server upload path when `SpeechRecognition`
  is not available (e.g. Firefox). This means dictation works out of the box in
  Chrome, Edge, and Safari without any API key configuration.
- Dedicated macOS Tauri-native surfaces may save `mac-native`, but do not
  assume the shared React settings default to it.
- Old stored `builder` values are treated as `builder-gemini`.
- Old stored `browser` values are treated as `mac-native`.
- Saved `google-realtime` preferences must never hit `/_agent-native/transcribe-voice`. They go through the dedicated session bridge `POST /_agent-native/transcribe-stream/session`, which mints an opaque ai-services websocket session and keeps the Google service-account JSON off the client.
- In the current bridge, the Google option is only actually ready when both the user's `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` secret exists and a managed AI services connection is configured, because the framework mints the managed ai-services session before streaming begins.

## Key resolution (server)

`transcribe-voice.ts` is batch-only. Do not add realtime streaming to this
route. Google Speech-to-Text realtime uses a dedicated audio-frame protocol:
client audio frames → `/_agent-native/transcribe-stream/session` →
ai-services WebSocket → Google gRPC `StreamingRecognize` → partial / final
transcript events. Use the canonical docs URL:
https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/v2/docs/streaming-recognize

Batch routing is based on the user's provider preference:

1. If `builder-gemini` and `resolveHasBuilderPrivateKey()` → calls `transcribeWithBuilder({ model: "gemini-3-1-flash-lite" })` via Builder proxy, or uses Builder Gemini Flash-Lite to clean up a live native/browser transcript when the desktop client sends text instead of audio.
2. If `builder` and `resolveHasBuilderPrivateKey()` → legacy alias; prefer `builder-gemini`.
3. If `gemini` → resolves the Gemini key under either name (`resolveGeminiApiKey`) and calls the direct Google Gemini path.
4. If `groq` → resolves `GROQ_API_KEY` and calls Groq's Whisper-compatible endpoint.
5. If `openai` → resolves `OPENAI_API_KEY`:
   - `readAppSecret({ key: "OPENAI_API_KEY", scope: "user", scopeId: session.email })` — user's encrypted secret.
   - `resolveCredential("OPENAI_API_KEY")` — env var + SQL settings fallback.

In auto mode / no preference, the route tries Builder Gemini Flash-Lite first
when Builder is connected, then Gemini BYOK, Groq, and OpenAI. The
organization's **Voice input** provider (Settings › Infrastructure, the
`manage-service-providers` action, org setting `service-providers`) moves one
of those to the front; a chosen provider with no key is skipped, a failed
Builder or Gemini attempt falls through, and the first Whisper-compatible
provider with a key answers. Read the order with
`serviceProviderOrder("voice", choice)`; never re-list it. The org choice
applies only when the user's own provider is auto: a user's single-provider
preference (and the live source: Mac native, Google realtime, or Batch) stays
per user and wins. An unreadable org setting fails the request with 503 rather
than using the default order, and `/_agent-native/voice-providers/status`
reports it as `orgProvider` (with `orgProviderLookupFailed` when unreadable).
When a request includes `instructions`, pass them through to the selected LLM
provider. Gemini uses them in the transcription prompt, Builder receives them
as transcription/cleanup instructions, and Whisper-compatible providers receive
them as provider prompt/context.

Requests may also include a multipart `voiceContext` JSON field. Parse it with
`parseVoiceContextPack()` from `@agent-native/core/voice` and pass the resulting
context through `buildVoiceGuidanceBlock()`; do not hand-roll separate prompt
formats. The context pack is for bounded snippets, active references, route/page
metadata, and preferred vocabulary/replacements only. Browser-native and Google
realtime final text can POST `{ text, provider, instructions, voiceContext }` to
`/_agent-native/transcribe-voice` when AI cleanup is enabled; batch audio can
send the same `voiceContext` field with its audio upload.

Never hardcode a shared key. Never log the value. Never echo it back to the
client.

## Overriding per-template

Templates can:
- **Disable the mic**: pass `voiceEnabled={false}` to `TiptapComposer`.
- **Replace the button**: wrap `TiptapComposer` and render your own `extraActionButton`; the framework mic stays immediately before the primary send/stop control. Use `stopButton` for an active-run control so the disabled send button becomes stop when the draft is empty and returns when the user types.
- **Pre-register provider keys as `required: true`**: call `registerRequiredSecret(...)` from your own server plugin when a template needs a specific BYOK provider in onboarding.

## Don'ts

- Don't call transcription providers from the client — go through `/_agent-native/transcribe-voice` so the user's secret stays server-side.
- Don't remove the cancel affordance — mic permission abuse paranoia is real.
- Don't auto-submit the transcript — users always edit before sending.
- Don't route realtime tool calls around the central guarded agent executor.
- Don't persist realtime audio or put provider keys in SDP/session payloads.
- Don't copy Cursor's "hide send when empty" pattern — it confuses users.
