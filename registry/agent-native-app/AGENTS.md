# Agent-Native App

Agent-Native apps treat the UI and the AI agent as equal partners. Anything the
UI can do should be available through the same SQL data and action surface that
the agent can use.

## Core Contract

- UI feedback: target 100 ms, never exceed 400 ms; acknowledge before network work.
- Data lives in SQL through Drizzle. Keep schemas provider agnostic.
- Normal app data must flow through actions. Define operations in `actions/`
  with `defineAction`; mark reads with `http: { method: "GET" }`; call them
  from React with `useActionQuery` / `useActionMutation` or `callAction`.
  Do not add duplicate JSON CRUD routes under `/api/*`, and do not add routes
  whose main job is to wrap, proxy, or re-export an action. Use custom routes
  only for route-only concerns such as uploads, streaming, webhooks, OAuth
  callbacks, public SEO/OG endpoints, or binary/static asset serving. If you
  are about to create a file under `server/routes/api/`, or middleware to guard
  one, stop and write a `defineAction` instead.
- All user-facing AI work goes through the agent chat. Do not call model
  providers or inline LLM APIs from UI or server code, and do not hide
  AI-shaped multi-step work in one action.
  Keep actions deterministic and focused; use the AgentSidebar for research,
  analysis, generation, recommendation, synthesis, and follow-ups in the same
  thread.
- Keep domain workflows on named routes and preserve the scaffold's full-page
  chat route. Use the right AgentSidebar for contextual AI and open it when a
  domain button hands work to the agent. Keep the first viewport sparse with
  progressive disclosure; never use sparkle, wand, magic, or robot icons as AI
  affordances.
- Page and section data loads use layout-matching `Skeleton` geometry, never a
  generic "Loading..." label. Reserve `Spinner` for brief mutations, uploads,
  and progress actions.
- Use a sans-first SaaS hierarchy with one restrained visual cue; reserve serif
  type for content previews. Give the AgentSidebar a subtle surface/divider
  boundary, and stack original/generated review vertically by default.
- Every AI-labeled button must call `sendToAgentChat()` with
  `openSidebar: true`; label deterministic local actions as local or preview.
- Before visual work, read `frontend-design` and `DESIGN.md`. Choose a named
  product direction and palette family, preserve existing brand tokens, and do
  not clone a neighboring app's accent by default.
- Application state belongs in SQL `application_state` so the agent can know the
  current route, selection, and focused object.
- Keep UIs in sync through `useDbSync()` and `/_agent-native/poll`.
- Every feature should cover UI, actions, skills or instructions, and
  application state when those areas apply.

## Implementation Rules

- Scale effort to the task. A small, well-specified change is a short read, the
  edit, and the app's existing checks — not a codebase survey, unrequested
  tests, or browser automation.
- Before using non-trivial Agent-Native APIs, read the version-matched package
  docs with `pnpm action docs-search --query "<topic>"` or
  `node_modules/@agent-native/core/docs`. When implementation examples or
  template patterns matter, use `pnpm action source-search --query "<pattern>"`
  or search `node_modules/@agent-native/core/corpus`.
- Before building common workspace or agent UI, read `agent-native-toolkit` to
  inventory existing public kits and installed package seams.
- For external integrations, inspect the workspace/provider connection catalog first; reuse its scoped resolver.
- Before overriding shared UI or integrations, read `customizing-agent-native`.
  Use the supported ladder: configure → compose → eject the smallest unit →
  propose a shared seam. Preview before `--apply`, commit
  `agent-native.ejections.json`, and never edit `node_modules`, deep-import
  private source, or eject protected runtime contracts.
- Use TypeScript for app source.
- Use shadcn/ui primitives for standard controls and dialogs.
- Do not use browser `alert`, `confirm`, or `prompt`; use app dialogs.
- Keep schema changes additive. Do not drop, rename, truncate, or destructively
  alter tables or columns.
- Tables with ownership columns require scoped reads and writes through the app's
  access helpers.
- Keep template code database agnostic and hosting agnostic.
- Prefer optimistic UI updates for routine actions, with rollback on error.

## Skills

Read the relevant `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` file before changing that area:

- `adding-a-feature` for the four-area feature checklist.
- `actions` for shared UI and agent operations.
- `storing-data`, `portability`, `security`, and `sharing` for data work.
- `frontend-design` and `shadcn-ui` for interface work.
- `agent-native-toolkit` before building common workspace or agent UI.
- `customizing-agent-native` for intentional app-owned shared-feature overrides.
- `client-side-routing`, `context-awareness`, and `real-time-sync` for
  navigation, agent-visible state, and live updates.
- `delegate-to-agent` when AI work should be handled by the agent chat.
