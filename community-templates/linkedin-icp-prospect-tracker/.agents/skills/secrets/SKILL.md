# Secrets Registry

## Non-negotiable rule

Never hardcode credential values. Source, docs, tests, fixtures, prompts, seed
data, and generated extension/app content may mention credential **names** such
as `OPENAI_API_KEY`, but must not contain real API keys, tokens, webhook URLs,
signing secrets, OAuth refresh tokens, or private Builder/customer data.

Never write real secrets to non-gitignored files. Put temporary secret material
under the root `.tmp/` or another explicitly gitignored path, then delete it
when it is no longer needed.

Provider secret values are supplied at runtime through the encrypted
`app_secrets` vault, `saveCredential` / `resolveCredential`, OAuth, or
`${keys.NAME}` substitution. Deployment configuration is reserved for
deploy-level secrets and non-provider configuration. Examples must use obvious
placeholders such as `<OPENAI_API_KEY>` or `${keys.SLACK_WEBHOOK}`, not
real-looking copied values.

Provider credentials and provider account identifiers are workspace data. Use
standard workspace connections and org/workspace vault scopes; never put them
in `.env` or deployment environment variables, and never add a provider-specific
action or startup bootstrap just to write a credential for one organization.

## Google OAuth triage

| Observation | Meaning | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `invalid_grant` from a deliberately fake code | Google accepted the client pair and rejected only the code | Do not rotate credentials; check flow state and callback registration |
| `invalid_client` | Google rejected the client id/secret pair | Verify the exact pair and deployment source before rotating |
| `redirect_uri_mismatch` | The client, host, callback path, and Google registration disagree | Compare that exact tuple in Google Cloud Console; publish a new deploy if site-scoped or build-time configuration changes |

Do not reason about this from memory. The probe checks both contracts: the
unqualified `/health/google` endpoint reports the sign-in contract, while
`/health/google?client=managed` reports deployment-level managed OAuth. It asks
Google directly whether each live `(client_id, redirect_uri)` pair is
registered:

```bash
pnpm check:google-redirect-uris -- --env all
```

The sign-in health path calls `checkGoogleSignInCredential()`, which prefers
the active Better Auth pair and otherwise uses `resolveGoogleSignInCredentials()`
from `packages/core/src/server/google-oauth-credentials.ts`. Managed health
calls `checkGoogleManagedCredential()`, which resolves
`["GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID", "GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET"]` through `resolveSecretPair()` in
`packages/core/src/server/credential-provider.ts`. App provider handlers use
`resolveGoogleProviderCredentialCandidatesWithReader()` with `resolveSecret`
under request context. These are separate flows and can intentionally land on
different Google clients, so a clean result for one says nothing about the
other. Read both contracts before changing anything:

```bash
curl -s https://HOST/_agent-native/health/google | jq '{clientId,mismatchedPairs,credentialSource}'
curl -s "https://HOST/_agent-native/health/google?client=managed" | jq '{clientId,mismatchedPairs,credentialSource}'
```

Different `clientId` values across those two, or `mismatchedPairs: true`, is a
divergence to understand, not damage to undo. Never repair it by rotating a
secret: writing a fresh value into whichever namespace the failing flow does
not read verifies clean and changes nothing. Do not collapse the namespaces
without first confirming which flow uses which client; separate sign-in and
managed clients on one host can be deliberate. For prebuilt Netlify deploys,
uploaded Functions read site-scoped secrets at runtime, and the health route
resolves them per request. The build may receive masked placeholder values.
After changing a site-scoped env var, publish a new deploy before verifying
live behavior. Call it a rebuild when the changed value is baked into build
output or static assets; a runtime-only secret does not need to be baked into
the bundle.

## Credential Modeling Preflight

Before registering a provider's fields, inspect the workspace/provider connection
catalog first. If a reusable connection exists, use its app grant and scoped
`resolveWorkspaceConnectionCredential(s)ForApp` path instead of registering a
parallel secret. Only classify fields for app-local setup when no reusable
connection exists:

- **API or service key** - register it as `kind: "api-key"` with the narrowest
  correct `scope`, a human label, a description, a docs link, and a validator.
- **OAuth authorization or refresh token** - use the OAuth token store and
  register a `kind: "oauth"` entry so the shared UI renders Connect and the
  runtime owns status, refresh, and reauthorization.
- **Deploy- or app-level configuration** - use deployment/runtime
  configuration, not a per-user secret row. For a non-secret public setting
  already represented by `AgentNativeConfig`, put the default in
  `agent-native.config.ts` and use its `AGENT_NATIVE_CONFIG_<PATH>` alias only
  for a deployment override. Never put a credential or provider key in that
  public namespace.
- **Account, customer, manager, or other non-secret identifier** - store it as
  scoped connection metadata or app data, not as a masked secret field.

`required: true` is for a logical setup requirement. If a provider needs
several values, do not automatically create one required checklist item per
field; use one composite onboarding step or a registered connection readiness
check.

Custom setup UI is allowed for provider-specific prerequisites, ordering, or
health checks, but it must delegate credential storage and connection state to
the shared vault/OAuth/settings surfaces.

## When to use

Use this for any external credential your template needs: API keys, service
tokens, webhook secrets. It gives you:

- A sidebar UI entry for each credential (masked input, rotate, test, delete).
- Automatic onboarding-checklist items for `required: true` secrets.
- A stable server-side read API (`readAppSecret`) that decrypts values on
  demand.
- Validator hooks for health-checking keys before save and from a Test button.

## When NOT to use

- OAuth flows that need to run the full authorization code exchange — use
  `@agent-native/core/oauth-tokens` directly to save/refresh tokens. The
  registry can still surface the OAuth connection in the sidebar by
  registering a secret with `kind: "oauth"` — that just delegates status
  lookup to oauth-tokens and renders a Connect button, no `app_secrets` row
  is written.
- Purely process-level env vars that are never user-facing (e.g. `NODE_ENV`,
  deployment flags). Those belong in the onboarding `form` method or the
  `envKeys` list in `core-routes-plugin`.

## Registering a secret

```ts
// server/plugins/register-secrets.ts
import { defineNitroPlugin } from "@agent-native/core/server";
import { registerRequiredSecret } from "@agent-native/core/secrets";

export default defineNitroPlugin(() => {
  registerRequiredSecret({
    key: "OPENAI_API_KEY",
    label: "OpenAI API Key",
    description: "Used for Whisper transcription of your recordings.",
    docsUrl: "https://platform.openai.com/api-keys",
    scope: "user",
    kind: "api-key",
    required: true,
    validator: async (value) => {
      const res = await fetch("https://api.openai.com/v1/models", {
        headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${value}` },
      });
      return res.ok
        ? { ok: true }
        : { ok: false, error: `OpenAI rejected the key (HTTP ${res.status})` };
    },
  });
});
```

### OAuth in the unified UI

```ts
registerRequiredSecret({
  key: "GOOGLE_CONNECTED",
  label: "Google account",
  description: "Grants access to Gmail / Calendar APIs.",
  scope: "user",
  kind: "oauth",
  required: true,
  oauthProvider: "google", // must match the provider id in oauth-tokens
  oauthConnectUrl: "/_agent-native/google/auth-url",
});
```

The sidebar shows a Connect button instead of a text input; no `app_secrets`
row is written — status is derived from `hasOAuthTokens("google")`.

## Registered options

| Field              | Type                                    | Purpose                                                                  |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `key`              | `string`                                | Env-var style name (`OPENAI_API_KEY`). Also the storage key.             |
| `label`            | `string`                                | Human-readable title in the sidebar.                                     |
| `description`      | `string?`                               | Subtitle under the label.                                                |
| `docsUrl`          | `string?`                               | "Get key" link rendered on the card.                                     |
| `scope`            | `"user" \| "workspace"`                 | Per-user or shared across the active org.                                |
| `kind`             | `"api-key" \| "oauth"`                  | Drives UI and storage behavior.                                          |
| `required`         | `boolean?`                              | When true, an onboarding step is auto-injected.                          |
| `validator`        | `(v) => Promise<boolean \| {ok,error}>` | Runs on save and from the Test button. Never log `v`.                    |
| `oauthProvider`    | `string?` (oauth-kind only)             | Provider id in `oauth-tokens` that backs this entry.                     |
| `oauthConnectUrl`  | `string?` (oauth-kind only)             | URL the Connect button points at.                                        |

## Reading a secret from an action

```ts
import { z } from "zod";
import { defineAction } from "@agent-native/core/action";
import { readAppSecret } from "@agent-native/core/secrets";
import { getRequestUserEmail } from "@agent-native/core/server";

export default defineAction({
  description: "Transcribe an audio file with Whisper",
  schema: z.object({ fileUrl: z.string() }),
  run: async ({ fileUrl }) => {
    const email = await getRequestUserEmail();
    if (!email) throw new Error("Not signed in");

    const stored = await readAppSecret({
      key: "OPENAI_API_KEY",
      scope: "user",
      scopeId: email,
    });
    const apiKey = stored?.value;
    if (!apiKey) {
      throw new Error(
        "OPENAI_API_KEY is not set. Add it in Settings.",
      );
    }

    // …call OpenAI. NEVER log the key or include it in error messages.
  },
});
```

Rules:

- **Never log the value.** The read layer enforces this server-side; your
  code must do the same.
- **Use env vars only for deploy-level secrets.** If a credential is
  user-scoped, org-scoped, or workspace-scoped, read the scoped vault/credential
  store. Do not add a `process.env` fallback that makes every user inherit one
  deployment's key.
- **Scope matches the registration.** `scope: "user"` → pass the user email.
  `scope: "workspace"` → pass the active `orgId` from
  `getOrgContext(event).orgId`.
- **One resolver per key, and every runtime path goes through it.** Before
  reading a credential, grep the app for the key name. If a resolver already
  exists (`resolveXConfig`, a connector, a client factory), call it — do not
  read `process.env` for that key a second time somewhere else.
- **Identity comes from the caller, not the module.** A shared helper under
  `server/lib/` takes the email as a parameter; only an entrypoint (action,
  route, cron) decides whose identity it is. A library that resolves its own
  identity from `process.env.AGENT_USER_EMAIL` authorizes the deployment rather
  than the caller.

The failure this prevents is not a leak — it is a split brain. When the config
check reads the vault and the feature reads `process.env`, the settings UI and
onboarding checklist report the integration as **configured** while every actual
call fails with "env var is required". The credential is right there in the
vault, so the error names the wrong cause and sends everyone hunting for a sync
or redeploy problem that does not exist. This has now shipped four times in one
app (BigQuery, Jira, Pylon, Academy).

Before finishing any change that touches a credential, run the guard from the
app directory — it finds this whether the app lives in `templates/` or in a
workspace repo:

```bash
npx agent-native doctor --only no-env-credentials
```

## `resolveCredential` sees exactly one organization

`resolveCredential(key, { userEmail, orgId })` checks the user scope, then the
one `orgId` you pass, then the solo workspace. That is the whole search. It is
correct for a signed-in request, and wrong for two common cases:

- **The caller has no organization.** A cron, a scheduled job, or any CLI run
  without a real member identity resolves no `orgId`, so only the user and solo
  scopes are ever consulted — and a shared key is in neither.
- **The key was synced under a different organization.** `app_secrets` has no
  scope visible to every org (`readAppSecret` is strict equality on
  `(scope, scope_id, key)`), so a key the vault UI advertises as available to
  every app is unreadable from any org except the one that ran the sync.

Both produce the same misleading "not set" that the split brain above produces,
which is why swapping `process.env` for `resolveCredential` can look like a fix
and change nothing. A workspace app should read shared keys through a resolver
that also sweeps the caller's other memberships and a designated vault org —
see `resolveConnectorSecret` and `AGENT_VAULT_ORG_ID` in the builder-workspace
repo for the shape, including the boot-time assertion that the deployment really
is single-tenant before a non-membership-gated fallback is safe.

**The doctor guard does not catch this second form** — it looks for
`process.env` reads, and `resolveCredential` is not one. Grep for
`resolveCredential` yourself and confirm each call sits somewhere a single-org
lookup is genuinely the right question. Findings that pair it with a
`?? process.env.KEY` fallback are the sanctioned deploy-level escape hatch; the
bugs are calls whose value can only live in another org's vault.

## HTTP routes

Core routes plugin mounts these under `/_agent-native/secrets/` automatically:

- `GET /_agent-native/secrets` — list registered secrets with status (`set`
  / `unset` / `invalid`), metadata, and — for set api-keys — the last 4
  characters. Values are never returned.
- `POST /_agent-native/secrets/:key` — body `{ value, scope?, scopeId? }`.
  Runs the registered validator; returns 400 with the error on failure.
- `DELETE /_agent-native/secrets/:key` — remove the stored value.
- `POST /_agent-native/secrets/:key/test` — re-run the validator against the
  currently stored value.

## Storage & encryption

- Values are stored in `app_secrets` (created on-demand; no migration
  needed).
- Values are encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM. Generic app-local secrets
  prefer `<APP_NAME>_SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (for example,
  `ANALYTICS_SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`), then `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, then
  `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`.
- Workspace-shared `app_secrets` prefer
  `WORKSPACE_SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, then the legacy shared
  `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, then a purpose-derived key from `A2A_SECRET`.
  Better Auth and app-scoped keys remain legacy read candidates; a successful
  legacy decrypt is compare-and-swap migrated to the preferred shared key
  without changing the row timestamp.
- Set the same stable `WORKSPACE_SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in every app that
  reads a shared vault. It is intentionally separate from app-local OAuth
  encryption. If the vault still relies on `A2A_SECRET`, rotating A2A material
  also rotates its encryption key. Add the stable vault key everywhere and
  read/migrate existing rows before rotating A2A.
- To rotate the dedicated workspace key itself, deploy the new value together
  with `WORKSPACE_SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY_PREVIOUS=<old value>`, let reads
  migrate ciphertext, then remove the previous key after the migration window.
- If no configured key material exists, development uses a machine-local
  fallback and logs a one-time warning. Production fails closed.

## Ad-hoc Keys

Ad-hoc keys are user-created secrets that are not declared by the template.
Users create them through the settings UI or the agent chat to use with
automations and the `web-request` tool. They support `${keys.NAME}`
substitution in outbound HTTP requests.

### Ad-hoc API

Core routes plugin mounts these under `/_agent-native/secrets/adhoc`:

- `GET /_agent-native/secrets/adhoc` — list all ad-hoc keys (name, last 4
  chars, URL allowlist). Values are never returned.
- `POST /_agent-native/secrets/adhoc` — body `{ name, value, urlAllowlist? }`.
  Creates or updates an ad-hoc key.
- `DELETE /_agent-native/secrets/adhoc/:name` — remove an ad-hoc key.

### URL Allowlists

Each ad-hoc key can have a URL allowlist — an array of origin URLs that
restrict where the key's value can be sent. The check is origin-level
(scheme + host + port). If no allowlist is configured, the key can be used
with any URL.

```ts
// Creating a key with an allowlist
POST /_agent-native/secrets/adhoc
{
  "name": "SLACK_WEBHOOK",
  "value": "<SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL_FROM_SETTINGS>",
  "urlAllowlist": ["https://hooks.slack.com"]
}
```

### `${keys.NAME}` Substitution

The `web-request` tool supports `${keys.NAME}` placeholders in the URL,
headers, and body. Substitution happens server-side after the agent emits
the tool call — the raw secret value never enters the agent's context.

```ts
import {
  resolveKeyReferences,
  validateUrlAllowlist,
} from "@agent-native/core/secrets/substitution";

// Resolve all ${keys.NAME} references in a string
const { resolved, usedKeys } = await resolveKeyReferences(
  "Bearer ${keys.API_TOKEN}",
  "user",
  "user@example.com",
);

// Validate a URL against a key's allowlist
const allowed = validateUrlAllowlist(
  "https://hooks.slack.com/services/<WORKSPACE>/<CHANNEL>/<SECRET>",
  ["https://hooks.slack.com"],
);
```

Key resolution falls back from user scope to workspace scope, so users can
override shared keys without breaking automations that reference workspace
defaults.

## Dispatch Vault Access

Dispatch workspaces have a vault access policy for workspace app credentials:

- `all-apps` is the default. Every saved Dispatch vault key is available to
  every workspace app; `sync-vault-to-app` pushes all vault keys to the target
  app.
- `manual` requires explicit per-app grants. Use
  `create-vault-grant` / `grant-vault-secrets-to-app`, then
  `sync-vault-to-app`.

Use `get-vault-access-settings` before deciding whether to create grants, and
use `set-vault-access-settings` only when the user asks to change the policy.

Vault keys land in the shared `app_secrets` store at `org` scope, so an app's
Settings → API keys tab reports them as `Set · Vault` through
`resolveSecretDetailed` (`source`/`scopeId`) instead of the registered-scope
row alone. Runtime precedence is personal (`user`) row → shared `org` row →
legacy `workspace` row → designated vault org → deploy env. Never add a second
place to enter a key that the Vault already provides; label the source instead.

### Key Files (ad-hoc)

| File                                           | Purpose                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `packages/core/src/secrets/substitution.ts`    | `resolveKeyReferences()`, `validateUrlAllowlist()` |
| `packages/core/src/tools/fetch-tool.ts`        | `web-request` tool consuming key references |
