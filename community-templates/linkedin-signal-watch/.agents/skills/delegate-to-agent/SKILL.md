  How to delegate all AI work to the agent chat. Use when delegating AI work
  from UI or scripts to the agent, when a user asks for agent behavior or
  LLM-powered features, when tempted to add inline LLM calls, or when sending
  messages to the agent from application code.

# Delegate All AI to the Agent

## Rule

The app's default AI surface is the agent chat. Any user-facing work that asks
the model to research, analyze, generate, recommend, synthesize, or reason over
multiple steps must start or continue in the AgentSidebar so users can see,
steer, and audit the work. UI buttons use `sendToAgentChat()` with
`openSidebar: true`, and follow-up or revision text belongs in that same thread
instead of a second app-local textbox.

Actions are tools, not alternate AI runtimes. Keep them deterministic and
focused: provider reads, validation, deterministic transforms, CRUD, and
persistence are good action work. Let the agent orchestrate several such tools
when the workflow is AI-shaped or user-steerable. Server-side one-shot model
calls are a rare escape hatch for narrow text transforms only; use
`completeText()` from `@agent-native/core/server` only when the work
intentionally does not need tools, chat history, run state, side effects, or
user steering.

## Why

The agent is the single AI interface. It has context about the full project, can read/write any file, and can run scripts. Inline LLM calls bypass this — they create a shadow AI that doesn't know what the agent knows and can't coordinate with it.

## How

**From the UI (client):**

```ts
import { sendToAgentChat } from "@agent-native/core/client/agent-chat";

sendToAgentChat({
  message: "Generate a summary of this document",
  context: documentContent, // optional hidden context (not shown in chat UI)
  submit: true, // auto-submit to the agent
  openSidebar: true,
});
```

### Keep user text separate from injected context

Treat the visible `message` as the user's request or the shortest clear
description of an app-initiated operation. Put context the user did not type —
IDs, URLs, filenames, current selection or screen state, serialized records,
upload instructions, and bounded source excerpts — in the `context` field.
`context` is model input carried through the agent turn; it is stripped from
the rendered user message, so do not concatenate it into `message` with labels,
blank-line sections, or `<context>` tags yourself.

Use the related surface for each kind of supporting input:

| Surface | Use for |
| --- | --- |
| `message` | User-authored intent or a concise app action description |
| `context` | Derived metadata and bounded text needed to carry out that intent |
| `setAgentChatContextItem` | Context staged for a later user-submitted prompt; keep it keyed so updates replace stale context |
| `images`, `referenceImagePaths`, attachments | Binary or visual inputs; describe only the handling instructions in `context` |

If an app builds a prompt from a form, selection, upload, or editor state, keep
the visible message short and pass the assembled details as `context`. Preserve
the user's actual freeform text in `message` when it is the request; do not
restate it as metadata in `context` unless the agent needs a structured copy.

This boundary applies to auto-submitted turns and prefills. A hidden context
field is not a license to send unbounded records or secrets: cap excerpts,
prefer stable IDs and URLs, and use an action or resource lookup for full data.

**From the UI, in the background:**

```ts
import { sendToAgentChat } from "@agent-native/core/client/agent-chat";

sendToAgentChat({
  message: "Analyze this import and create any missing records",
  context: `Import batch id: ${batchId}`,
  submit: true,
  newTab: true,
  background: true,
  openSidebar: false,
});
```

This is still a full agent run: tools, actions, thread state, and run tracking
all remain active. It simply does not focus or open the sidebar.

Use this silent form only for explicitly background or system-initiated work.
It is not the default for a user clicking an AI-labeled button; visible work
should open the sidebar so the user can follow and redirect the run.

**From scripts (Node):**

```ts
import { agentChat } from "@agent-native/core";

agentChat.submit("Process the uploaded images and create thumbnails");
```

**For narrow server-side text transforms:**

```ts
import { completeText } from "@agent-native/core/server";

const result = await completeText({
  systemPrompt: "Return exactly one sentiment label.",
  input: messageBody,
  maxOutputTokens: 12,
  temperature: 0,
});
```

If the narrow exception is exposed to the UI, wrap it in an action so the UI
and agent share the same operation. Keep it clearly non-conversational and do
not call provider SDKs directly.

**From the UI, detecting when agent is done:**

```ts
import { useAgentChatGenerating } from "@agent-native/core/client/agent-chat";

function MyComponent() {
  const isGenerating = useAgentChatGenerating();
  // Show loading state while agent is working
}
```

## `submit` vs Prefill

The `submit` option controls whether the message is sent automatically or placed in the chat input for user review:

| `submit` value | Behavior                                | Use when                                                                            |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `true`         | Auto-submits to the agent immediately   | Routine operations with clear intent; keep `openSidebar: true` for visible work |
| `false`        | Prefills the AgentSidebar composer      | Review, edit, or add detail before the run; use the existing sidebar thread   |
| omitted        | Uses the project's default setting      | General-purpose delegation                                                       |

```ts
// Auto-submit: routine operation
sendToAgentChat({ message: "Update the project summary", submit: true });

// Prefill: let user review before sending
sendToAgentChat({
  message: "Delete all projects older than 30 days",
  submit: false,
  openSidebar: true,
});
```

## Capture user input in the sidebar

The AgentSidebar composer is the default prompt surface. When a button needs
the user to describe what to create, prefill that same composer and let the
user edit or complete it:

```tsx
<Button
  onClick={() =>
    sendToAgentChat({
      message: "Help me create a research report from this brief:",
      context: researchBrief,
      submit: false,
      openSidebar: true,
    })
  }
>
  Start in agent
</Button>
```

Never auto-submit a generic creative prompt when the user has not said what
they want. Auto-submit without additional input is fine when intent is
unambiguous:

- "Try to fix" on a tool error — submits the error details with a clear fix instruction
- "Retry the last operation" after a transient failure
- Single-purpose buttons where there is nothing meaningful for the user to add

Use a Popover only for compact, structured parameters the UI must validate,
such as a date range, target, or approval choice. Do not add a second freeform
prompt or follow-up textbox for an AI workflow; keep the conversation and
revisions in the AgentSidebar thread.

## Delegating to a Sub-Agent (Agent Teams)

`sendToAgentChat()` delegates from app code _to_ the agent. The other axis of
delegation is the agent handing work _to a sub-agent_ through the Agent Teams
run-manager. The main chat stays the orchestrator: it spawns sub-agents, then
reads and integrates their results.

### When to spawn a sub-agent vs do it yourself

- **Do it yourself** when the work is small, on the critical path, or tightly
  coupled to what you're already doing. Sub-agent overhead and coordination risk
  outweigh the benefit.
- **Spawn a sub-agent** for a self-contained unit of work that can run
  independently — a disjoint investigation, an isolated implementation slice, a
  long-running search — especially when it frees the main thread to keep
  orchestrating.

### Briefing contract

Every sub-agent brief must specify four things, or the sub-agent will guess:

- **Objective** — the one concrete outcome it owns, in a sentence.
- **Context** — the facts it needs (paths, prior findings, constraints) so it
  doesn't re-derive them.
- **Output** — the exact shape you want back (a summary, a file edited, a list
  of paths, a yes/no with rationale).
- **Boundaries** — what it must NOT touch (files, branches, side effects) and
  when to stop and report rather than push forward.

### Fan-out discipline

- **Default to a single sub-agent.** Most delegation is one focused task.
- **Spawn multiple only for genuinely independent units** that don't share state
  or files. Never parallelize coupled work — if B needs A's output, run them in
  sequence.
- **Cap parallel fan-out at ~3.** More sub-agents means more synthesis cost and
  more chance of conflicting edits to the same area.

### Synthesis discipline

- **Read every result** before concluding — don't act on the first one back.
- **Reconcile conflicts** between sub-agent findings explicitly; decide which is
  right rather than averaging or ignoring.
- **Integrate into one answer.** The main thread produces the single coherent
  result; it never just forwards raw sub-agent transcripts to the user.

Background sub-agents must use the core run-manager / Agent Teams infrastructure
rather than ad-hoc LLM calls.

## Don't

- Don't `import Anthropic from "@anthropic-ai/sdk"` in client or server code
- Don't `import OpenAI from "openai"` in client or server code
- Don't make direct API calls to any LLM provider
- Don't use AI SDK functions like `generateText()`, `streamText()`, etc.
- Don't build "AI features" that bypass the agent chat
- Don't auto-submit a hardcoded prompt for generative actions — capture user input first (see above)
- Don't use `completeText()` for workflows that need tools, database writes,
  auditability, user steering, or multi-step reasoning. Use the agent chat
  instead, optionally with `background: true`.

## Exception

Scripts may call external APIs (image generation, search, etc.) — but the AI
reasoning and orchestration still goes through the agent. A script is a tool
the agent uses, not a replacement for the agent.

`completeText()` is allowed for small server-side transforms such as
classification, extraction, rewriting a short string, or normalizing messy
provider text. It deliberately runs with `tools: []` and does not create chat
thread state.

## When to Use A2A Instead

`sendToAgentChat()` delegates work to the **local** agent — the one running alongside your app. When the work should go to a **different** agent entirely (e.g., asking an analytics agent for data, or a calendar agent for availability), use the A2A (agent-to-agent) protocol instead.

```ts
import { callAgent } from "@agent-native/core/a2a";

// Call a different agent — not the local agent chat
const stats = await callAgent(
  "https://analytics.example.com",
  "What were last week's signups?",
  { apiKey: process.env.ANALYTICS_A2A_KEY },
);
```

See the **a2a-protocol** skill for the full pattern.
