/**
 * guard-no-blob-column-predicate.mjs
 *
 * A `WHERE` predicate on a large text/JSON column makes `LIMIT` USELESS.
 *
 * Postgres stores big values out of line (TOAST). A predicate that reads such a
 * column forces a fetch and detoast of the full value for EVERY row the scan
 * touches — and that happens BEFORE `LIMIT` applies, so asking for fewer rows
 * does not cost less. The column does not even have to be selected.
 *
 * Measured in production on the agent chat sidebar list, which returns ~20 rows
 * of {title, updatedAt} and nothing else:
 *
 *   thread_data NOT LIKE '%"integrationDeliveryAttempted":true%'
 *
 *   with the predicate      2207ms / 2258ms   (8512 bytes returned)
 *   without it               222ms /  309ms   (same 8512 bytes)
 *   with it, at limit=5     3166ms            (2000 bytes returned)
 *
 * `limit=5` costing MORE than `limit=20` is the fingerprint of this bug: the
 * work is proportional to rows scanned and bytes detoasted, not rows returned.
 *
 * ## What is flagged, and what deliberately is not
 *
 * Flagged: a `LIKE` / `NOT LIKE` / `ILIKE` against a heavy column where the
 * pattern is a HARDCODED LITERAL. That shape is a marker lookup — some flag
 * buried inside a JSON blob — and a marker belongs in its own indexed column.
 * The one that caused the outage above was a legacy compensator for rows
 * written before `source_platform` existed; the fix was to backfill that column
 * once in a migration and delete the predicate.
 *
 * NOT flagged: the same match against a BOUND PARAMETER (`?`, `$1`). That is a
 * user-supplied search term, and searching inside message history is a real
 * feature with no cheaper implementation. `searchThreads` does exactly this and
 * must keep working. Distinguishing on literal-vs-parameter is what keeps this
 * guard from crying wolf at legitimate full-text search.
 *
 * If a literal match against a blob is genuinely the right call, say so on the
 * line so a reviewer sees the decision:
 *
 *   // guard:allow-blob-predicate — short reason
 *
 * Known limitation, stated so a pass is not misread as coverage: this matches
 * a PHYSICAL LINE. A predicate split across lines — the column at the end of
 * one, `NOT LIKE '…'` at the start of the next — is invisible here. Closing
 * that needs SQL-aware parsing of template literals, not a longer regex.
 * The formatting this codebase actually produces keeps the comparison on one
 * line (oxfmt does not break inside a template literal), which is why a
 * line-oriented check is worth having rather than nothing.
 *
 * Same diff-base contract as every guard built on changed-lines.mjs: if the
 * base cannot be resolved the guard exits GUARD_EXIT_COULD_NOT_RUN, which
 * run-guards.ts reports as SKIPPED, because a silent pass would look identical
 * to a real clean run.

Matching a literal against a large text/JSON column forces Postgres to fetch
and detoast that value for every row the scan touches, BEFORE LIMIT applies.
Measured on the chat sidebar list: 2207ms with the predicate, 222ms without,
and 3166ms at limit=5 — asking for fewer rows cost MORE.

A marker you match with a hardcoded string belongs in its own column:
  - add the column, backfill it once in a migration, then filter on it
  - a legacy compensator on a read path is a backfill you have not done yet,
    and you pay for it on every request until you do

Searching a blob against a BOUND PARAMETER is a real feature and is not
flagged; only hardcoded literals are.

If the literal match is genuinely right, say so on the line:
  // guard:allow-blob-predicate — short reason
