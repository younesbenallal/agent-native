/**
 * guard-no-boot-data-work.mjs
 *
 * These apps run as serverless functions, so a server plugin's startup body is
 * not "once per deploy" — it is once per COLD START, on the critical path of
 * the request unlucky enough to trigger it, and again on the next cold start.
 * Data work placed there is therefore paid over and over, forever, by users.
 *
 * This has cost real outages and sustained slowness, not hypothetical ones:
 * Slides startup slowness, Analytics paying startup cost on API calls, and a
 * production outage. The shape that did it looks like this, awaited in a
 * plugin's default export before anything can be served:
 *
 *   await migrations(nitroApp);
 *   await retypeBooleanColumnsOnPostgres();   // rewrites tables on Postgres
 *   await backfillLegacyClipsTables();
 *   await syncWorkspacesToOrganizations();
 *   await backfillRecordingOrgId();
 *
 * Schema DDL used to be exempt here, on the reasoning that migrations are
 * bounded and short-circuit cheaply. That was an assumption, and it was wrong:
 * on the Analytics production database (180 tables, 1920 columns) the migration
 * "fast path" measured 5.5s and the information_schema probe 8.3s. Health
 * checks timed out at 25s and the app was effectively down. The exemption is
 * how the pattern survived a cleanup meant to remove it — so there is no
 * exemption any more. Anything awaited in a plugin body is flagged, schema
 * setup included, and anything that truly must run first says so on the line.
 *
 * Where to put it instead — all three already exist in this repo:
 *   - a scheduled job / cron (see the `recurring-jobs` and `automations` skills),
 *   - a one-off CLI or script run at release time, deliberately, once,
 *   - lazily, behind the first caller that actually needs the data, memoized.
 *
 * Scope: only lines ADDED on this branch (via scripts/lib/changed-lines.mjs),
 * under a template's, app's, or package's server directory, plus any Nitro
 * plugin implementation anywhere in `packages/`, `templates/`, or `apps/`. The
 * existing boot-time backlog is a separate, schedulable cleanup — this stops
 * the habit from growing, which is the only thing a guard can honestly do.
 *
 * Known limitation, stated so nobody reads a pass as full coverage: this is a
 * line-oriented heuristic bounded by `MAX_STARTUP_INDENT`, so boot work nested
 * deeper stays invisible. `agent-chat-plugin.ts` builds its action registries
 * inside an `initPromise` IIFE at indent 6+, and none of it is reachable here.
 * Closing that needs real structural analysis, not a wider regex — widening
 * the indent alone would flag request handlers in the same file and turn the
 * pragma into noise.
 *
 * Opt-out, when the work genuinely must happen before serving and is bounded:
 *
 *   // guard:allow-boot-data-work — short reason
 *
 * Same diff-base contract as every guard built on changed-lines.mjs: if the
 * base cannot be resolved the guard exits GUARD_EXIT_COULD_NOT_RUN, which
 * run-guards.ts reports as SKIPPED, because a silent pass here would look
 * identical to a real clean run.
