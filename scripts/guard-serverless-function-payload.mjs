/**
 * guard-serverless-function-payload.mjs
 *
 * Everything the deploy build copies into the serverless server directory is
 * paid by EVERY emitted function, including the page-render one, on every cold
 * start — Netlify clones that directory once per function, so the weight is
 * multiplied, not shared.
 *
 * This is not hypothetical. PR #2684 ("Harden auth and cold-start data paths")
 * added two package names to a copy list and one unconditional call:
 *
 *   const SERVERLESS_BROWSER_RUNTIME_PACKAGES = [
 *     "@sparticuz/chromium",
 *     "playwright-core",
 *   ] as const;
 *   ...
 *   copyInstalledBrowserRuntimePackages(nitro.options.output.serverDir);
 *
 * ~10 lines, in a diff about auth. It put 78MB of headless Chromium into the
 * page function of every app in the fleet — the docs function went 59.8MB ->
 * 159.9MB — and agent-native.com cache-miss TTFB measured 4.15-6.03s. Nothing
 * in review connected that diff to that number, because nothing pointed at it.
 * The build-time size report only fires when an app is actually built for a
 * serverless preset, which is deploy time, not PR time.
 *
 * So this guard pins the payload surface itself:
 *
 *   1. Which `copyInstalled*` helpers the deploy build calls at all.
 *   2. Which packages `SERVERLESS_BROWSER_RUNTIME_PACKAGES` names.
 *   3. That `copyInstalledBrowserRuntimePackages` still asks
 *      `findServerlessBrowserRuntimeConsumer` whether THIS app wants a browser.
 *      That gate is the whole fix: package resolution cannot answer it, because
 *      in a workspace every app "resolves" a sibling's Chromium.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately one directory, not a repo-wide grep for "chromium".
 * Measured before writing: `copyInstalled*(` has exactly 4 call sites in the
 * whole tree outside specs, all in packages/core/src/deploy/build.ts. A wider
 * matcher would fire on unrelated code and be disabled inside a week.
 *
 * Opt-out, when the added weight is deliberate and measured:
 *
 *   // guard:allow-serverless-function-payload — +Xmb, why every function needs it
 *
 * Read .agents/skills/performance/SKILL.md section 9 ("Cold start is the
 * artifact, not just the work it does") before reaching for it.
