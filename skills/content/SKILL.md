  Use Content for repo-backed Markdown/MDX docs, blogs, resources, rich
  document editing, local components, shareable copies, and Content local-file
  workspaces. Prefer Content actions over raw filesystem writes when available.

# Content

Use the Content app when a workflow is about authoring, editing, reviewing, or
publishing Markdown/MDX documents: docs sites, blogs, resource libraries,
marketing pages, internal notes, and local MDX components. Content gives the
agent a document tree, a rich editor, normal document actions, and optional
local-file source of truth.

## Choose The Path

- Use Content actions when the Content MCP/action tools are available:
  `list-documents`, `search-documents`, `get-document`, `pull-document`,
  `create-document`, `edit-document`, `update-document`, `delete-document`,
  `share-local-file-document`, `list-local-component-files`, and
  `write-local-component-file`.
- Use `pull-document` or `get-document` before editing a page. Use
  `edit-document` for precise find/replace changes and `update-document` for
  full rewrites or new content.
- In Local File Mode, Content actions read and write the repo files declared in
  `agent-native.json`; SQL remains cache/history/search glue, not the source of
  truth for those pages.
- If Content tools are not visible and no local Content app or Desktop bridge is
  running, treat this skill as repo-editing guidance. Edit configured
  `.md`/`.mdx` files directly, preserve frontmatter and MDX imports, and tell
  the user the Content action surface was not available.

## Action Examples

Prefer JSON input for action calls:

```bash
pnpm action list-documents
pnpm action get-document '{"id":"local-file:..."}'
pnpm action edit-document '{"id":"local-file:...","find":"old copy","replace":"new copy"}'
pnpm action update-document '{"id":"local-file:...","content":"# Updated\n\nBody"}'
pnpm action share-local-file-document '{"id":"local-file:..."}'
```

Run `refresh-list` after create/update/delete operations when you need the open
Content UI sidebar to repaint immediately.

## Local File Mode

Install into an existing repo with:

```bash
npx @agent-native/core@latest skills add content --mode local-files --scope project
```

The installer copies this skill and writes or updates `agent-native.json` with
Content roots for `docs/`, `blog/`, `content/`, and `resources/`, plus a
`components/` folder for local MDX components. A typical manifest looks like:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "apps": {
    "content": {
      "mode": "local-files",
      "roots": [
        {
          "name": "Docs",
          "path": "docs",
          "kind": "docs",
          "extensions": [".md", ".mdx"]
        },
        {
          "name": "Blog",
          "path": "blog",
          "kind": "blog",
          "extensions": [".md", ".mdx"]
        },
        {
          "name": "Content",
          "path": "content",
          "kind": "content",
          "extensions": [".md", ".mdx"]
        },
        {
          "name": "Resources",
          "path": "resources",
          "kind": "resources",
          "extensions": [".md", ".mdx"]
        }
      ],
      "components": "components",
      "extensions": "extensions",
      "hide": ["**/_*.md", "**/_*.mdx"]
    }
  }
}
```

Local File Mode does not make the host language model local, and the hosted
Content app cannot read private repo files by itself. File access requires a
local Content app, Agent-Native Desktop, or another trusted local bridge.

## MDX And Components

- Preserve frontmatter keys you do not understand. Preserve MDX imports,
  exports, JSX, and expression props unless the user explicitly asks to change
  them.
- Use local components from the configured `components` folder. Components
  should be PascalCase exports from `.tsx` files; simple editable input metadata
  can live next to them as `ComponentNameInputs`.
- Use `list-local-component-files` and `write-local-component-file` for
  component source changes when Content tools are available. Otherwise edit the
  component files directly like normal repo source.

## Boundaries

- Moving, renaming, and reordering local-file pages are not first-class Content
  UI operations yet. Use normal file operations when the user asks for those,
  then let Content rediscover the file tree.
- Do not push/pull Notion, Builder.io, or other provider-backed content unless
  the user explicitly asks for provider sync.
- Do not paste secrets, private provider data, or credential-looking values into
  docs, generated pages, frontmatter, examples, or local components.
