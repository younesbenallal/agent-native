      // Syntax highlighting is hydrated after the document loads. Keeping
      // Shiki out of the SSR graph avoids loading its language catalog on a
      // cold docs Function just to render the initial Markdown shell.
      // These render in the browser only — the server just passes the fence
      // source through (app/components/docBlocks.tsx), and MermaidBlock draws
      // it in a post-mount effect. Core already classifies all three as
      // browser-only (BROWSER_ONLY_SERVER_LIBS), but that list stubs Nitro's
      // graph, and Vite's SSR build resolves them to relative chunk paths
      // first, so Nitro never sees the bare specifier. Stubbing here is what
      // actually reaches them. Measured on the netlify preset: server function
      // 62.8MB -> 55.9MB, and the deploy uploads two copies of it, so 125.6MB
      // -> 111.8MB. Excalidraw does not resolve from this package directly; it
      // arrives through @agent-native/core, which is why naming it still works.
      // The editor stack and terminal are client-only here: docs never
      // server-renders the agent sidebar or the resource editor, but their leaf
      // code still landed in the SSR bundle. lowlight stays real (core's doc
      // block highlighter runs server-side via preloadDocBlocksContent), and so
      // do yjs/y-protocols/lib0 (core collab uses yjs on the server).
      // Deliberately NOT stubbing "vgpu": the hero ocean renderer imports its
      // named exports at module scope, and a stub exports nothing, so the SSR
      // build fails on MISSING_EXPORT rather than tree-shaking cleanly. It is
      // also unnecessary -- the Dawn native adapter is reachable only through
      // the `vgpu/node` entry, which nothing here imports. The browser runtime
      // that does land in the server graph is inert JS, and
      // tests/hero-background-bundle.test.ts holds the line that matters:
      // no @vgpu/adapter-node and no .node binary in dist/server.
