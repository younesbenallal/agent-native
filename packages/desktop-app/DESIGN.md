# Desktop chat-first workbench

## Direction

The desktop is a quiet command center: a narrow, persistent conversation rail,
a generous chat canvas, and contextual app panes that appear when the user or
agent asks for one. It borrows the information architecture of Codex and T3
Code while keeping Agent-Native's existing surface, typography, iconography,
and app URLs.

## Layout contract

- The shared Code Agents rail owns New chat, search, subscriptions, computer
  access, pinned/recent chat history, and the composer.
- Desktop adds Integrations and Scheduled as first-party rail actions and
  shows at most six workspace apps above Chats.
- App panes use the existing Electron AppWebview and have a small title row,
  no address bar, and no nested app/sidebar chrome.
- Chat rows expose a right-click menu for copying the stable session ID and
  opening a live watch/message panel backed by the existing run-manager host.
- The contextual side-surface shell currently ships app, browser, and
  watched-session surfaces. Terminal, files, diff, and live-agent panes stay
  explicit deferred cards until their platform-specific data boundaries are
  connected.
- Chat-first is the only desktop shell. There is no alternate app-first mode or
  shell preference.

## Future boundary

Cloud handoff should move the same thread/run descriptor to a worker
residence, not create a second conversation. This mode only establishes the
local contextual-pane seam; computer use remains local until that worker
contract is implemented.
