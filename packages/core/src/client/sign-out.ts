/**
 * The one client-side sign-out.
 *
 * Every surface used to hand-roll the same three steps — POST the logout route,
 * then navigate — and every copy had the same gap between them: the app shell
 * stayed mounted and authenticated while the cookie was already gone, so its
 * queries 401ed and painted a load failure over the app the user was trying to
 * leave. A hard refresh looked fine because a fresh document has no stale
 * client state to disagree with.
 *
 * Ordering is the whole point and it is not symmetric:
 *
 *  1. `beginSignOut()` first, so no surface renders authenticated UI or issues
 *     an authenticated request for the rest of this document's life. Doing this
 *     after the request leaves that window open; invalidating a cache instead
 *     only schedules a re-read, which answers "authenticated" until it lands.
 *  2. Revoke the server session, and WAIT for it. Navigating first can abandon
 *     the request and leave the session live — the user would be silently
 *     signed back in on their next visit.
 *  3. On success, leave with a full location change so the next document
 *     re-runs the server auth guard from scratch. On failure, reload the
 *     current document so it can re-read the still-authoritative session.
