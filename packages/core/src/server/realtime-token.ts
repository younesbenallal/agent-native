/**
 * Realtime subscribe-token mint endpoint.
 *
 * `GET /_agent-native/realtime-token` — the one Netlify request per page load
 * that the hosted Realtime Gateway path needs. The SSR HTML/`.data` shell is a
 * single impersonal, CDN-cached document (`guard:ssr-cache-shell`), so a
 * per-visitor token cannot be baked into the page; the client mints it here
 * after load. Same-origin + session-gated; sessionless requests get 401.
 *
 * The signed token binds this app's Builder project id (the gateway channel)
 * and carries the app's own end-user identity (`owner` = session email, `orgId`
 * = framework org) — the exact tuple `recordChange` stamps onto `sync_events`
 * and the gateway feeds to `canSeeChangeForUser`. It is signed with the app's
 * per-project HMAC secret, injected as a reserved env var at provision time.

/**
 * The channel this app actually mints against: the pipeline's injected pair,
 * or the one it registered for itself.
 *
 * The discriminator is the whole point and it has exactly one correct form:
 * self-register only when NEITHER half of the injected pair is present. Either
 * half alone means the hosting pipeline owns this app and already gave the
 * gateway its database, so the fix for the missing half is a redeploy, not a
 * second `rt_` channel tailing a database Builder already holds. Gating on the
 * project id alone is not enough — `resolveBuilderBranchProjectId()` returns
 * `""` for an UNREADABLE settings row as well as an absent one
 * (builder-browser.ts), so one Neon blip would register a genuine pipeline
 * app's database under a duplicate channel.
 *
 * This lives here because the mint is not the only caller: the public
 * `/_agent-native/health` probe resolves it too (and registers on a miss), and
 * a probe that used HALF the discriminator would do exactly that on one
 * anonymous curl. `gateway-access-check.ts` applies the same rule against the
 * SYNC, env-only project id — it runs without request context — so it spells
 * it out rather than calling this.
 *
 * Callers must supply request context where they have it: the scoped-secret
 * fallback inside `resolveBuilderBranchProjectId` reads the request-context
 * ALS, and without it only env vars resolve.
 *
 * Rejects rather than swallowing: "no channel" and "could not find out" are
 * different answers, and `/_agent-native/health` reports them as different
 * fields. Callers that owe a client a status code catch it themselves.
