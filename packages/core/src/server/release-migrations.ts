 * still reports success — `Applied migration ...` lines, a zero exit, a
 * published deploy — so this has to fail here or it fails silently forever.
 *
 * Scoped to `CONTEXT=production` on purpose. The beta lane deliberately builds
 * with `AGENT_NATIVE_RUN_RELEASE_MIGRATIONS=1` under a branch-deploy context
 * against masked site secrets, and its database is migrated by the beta
 * publish step — so keying off that flag would fail every beta deploy while
 * never guarding the production one this exists for.
