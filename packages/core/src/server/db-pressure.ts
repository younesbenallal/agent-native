// Database pressure — the three signals that precede an outage, measured from
// inside the app that owns the database.
//
// The analytics app degraded for hours on 2026-08-06 before it fell over, and
// every check we had said UP until the moment it said DOWN. What was actually
// true, and visible in `pg_stat_activity` the whole time:
//
//   - 11-20 connections stuck `idle in transaction` up to 283s, left behind by
//     serverless workers killed mid-transaction. They hold locks; nothing
//     reaped them.
//   - `SELECT 1` drifting from ~0.2s to 6s as those locks accumulated.
//   - 47-56 concurrent copies of one unprojected query, each dragging a JSON
//     blob per row.
//
// None of that is "down". All of it is the hour before down. A monitor that
// only distinguishes 200 from 500 cannot see any of it.
//
// This lives in core rather than in a workstation script because the numbers
// require a database credential, and the app already has its own. Reading them
// here means the scheduled fleet audit needs no production credentials at all.
// `scripts/chat-health.mjs` measures the same three signals locally against
// every app at once; `db-pressure.spec.ts` pins the two threshold sets equal.
