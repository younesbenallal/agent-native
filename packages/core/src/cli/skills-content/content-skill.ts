# Content

Use the Content app when a workflow is about authoring, editing, reviewing, or
publishing Markdown/MDX documents: docs sites, blogs, resource libraries,
marketing pages, internal notes, and local MDX components. Content gives the
agent a document tree, a rich editor, normal document actions, and optional
local-folder synchronization.

## Connect Content

If Content actions are already visible, use them. Otherwise connect the host to
the Content app descriptor's hosted MCP URL (the hosted service uses
\`https://content.agent-native.com/mcp\`). OAuth-capable hosts should add that
remote MCP URL and let the user complete the host-owned sign-in and consent
step. Claude uses its custom Connectors flow; Claude Code adds the same remote
HTTP URL and authenticates from \`/mcp\`; ChatGPT/OpenAI, Cursor, Grok/xAI, and
other OAuth-capable MCP hosts use their custom connector or MCP settings.

Use the browser for OAuth or consent, an MCP App or focused artifact handoff,
or interaction that genuinely exists only in the UI. When Content actions are
available, do not replace Content reads, analysis, or ordinary changes with
browser automation. After authorization, inspect the tools the host actually
provides and use only those tools; do not infer unavailable capabilities from
this skill.

Codex and Claude Cowork do not use remote MCP OAuth. Open the app's
\`/mcp/connect\` page or run
\`npx @agent-native/core@latest connect https://content.agent-native.com\` for
their browser-authorized device-code flow. Other clients without remote OAuth
use the same fallback. Never ask the user to paste a token into chat.

## Choose The Path

- Use Content actions when the Content MCP/action tools are available:
  \`list-documents\`, \`search-documents\`, \`get-document\`,
  \`pull-document\`, \`create-document\`, \`edit-document\`,
  \`update-document\`, \`delete-document\`,
  \`sync-manifest-local-folder-source\`, \`sync-local-folder-source\`,
  \`list-local-component-files\`, and \`write-local-component-file\`.
- Use \`pull-document\` or \`get-document\` before editing a page. Use
  \`edit-document\` for precise find/replace changes and \`update-document\`
  for full rewrites or new content.
- Local folders declared in \`agent-native.json\` are sources for ordinary
  SQL-backed Content pages. Use the trusted bridge's pull/check/push workflows to
  synchronize them; normal document actions always operate on the database.
- If Content tools remain unavailable after the applicable hosted connection
  path, and no local Content app or Desktop bridge is running, treat this skill
  as repo-editing guidance. Edit configured
  \`.md\`/\`.mdx\` files directly, preserve frontmatter and MDX imports, and tell
  the user the Content action surface was not available.

## Action Examples

Prefer JSON input for action calls:

\`\`\`bash
pnpm action list-documents
pnpm action get-document '{"id":"document-id"}'
pnpm action edit-document '{"id":"document-id","find":"old copy","replace":"new copy"}'
pnpm action update-document '{"id":"document-id","content":"# Updated\\n\\nBody"}'
\`\`\`

Run \`refresh-list\` after create/update/delete operations when you need the
open Content UI sidebar to repaint immediately.

## Local Folder Sources

Install into an existing repo with:

\`\`\`bash
npx @agent-native/core@latest skills add content --mode local-files --scope project
\`\`\`

The installer copies this skill and writes or updates \`agent-native.json\` with
database-backed local-folder sources for \`docs/\`, \`blog/\`, \`content/\`, and
\`resources/\`, plus a \`components/\` folder for local MDX components. A trusted
local bridge imports these files into the workspace's canonical Files database.
Run \`sync-manifest-local-folder-source\` with a root's generated
\`source.connectionId\`, or launch \`agent-native content local-files <target>\`,
to connect and pull it. A typical root looks like:

\`\`\`json
{
  "version": 1,
  "apps": {
    "content": {
      "roots": [
        {
          "name": "Docs",
          "path": "docs",
          "kind": "docs",
          "extensions": [".md", ".mdx"],
          "source": {
            "type": "local-folder",
            "connectionId": "local-folder:<opaque-id>",
            "truthPolicy": "source_primary"
          }
        }
      ],
      "components": "components",
      "extensions": "extensions",
      "hide": ["**/_*.md", "**/_*.mdx"]
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

Local-folder synchronization does not make the host language model local, and
the hosted Content app cannot read private repo files by itself. File access
requires a local Content app, Agent-Native Desktop, or another trusted bridge.

## MDX And Components

- Preserve frontmatter keys you do not understand. Preserve MDX imports,
  exports, JSX, and expression props unless the user explicitly asks to change
  them.
- Use local components from the configured \`components\` folder. Components
  should be PascalCase exports from \`.tsx\` files; simple editable input metadata
  can live next to them as \`ComponentNameInputs\`.
- Use \`list-local-component-files\` and \`write-local-component-file\` for
  component source changes when Content tools are available. Otherwise edit the
  component files directly like normal repo source.

## Boundaries

- A database page and its source file can change independently. Use folder
  check/pull/push and resolve reported conflicts rather than silently overwriting
  either revision.
- Do not push/pull Notion, Builder.io, or other provider-backed content unless
  the user explicitly asks for provider sync.
- Do not paste secrets, private provider data, or credential-looking values into
  docs, generated pages, frontmatter, examples, or local components.
