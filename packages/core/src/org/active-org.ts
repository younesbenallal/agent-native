/**
 * Every write to `active-org-id` goes through here, so no call site can move an
 * account between organizations silently. Vault credentials are scoped per
 * organization, so a repoint makes every key synced under the previous org
 * unreadable for that account, and the only symptom is a missing-credential
 * error naming the key. The UI notices (`org.createOrgVaultNotice`,
 * `org.acceptInvitationOrgSwitchNotice`) only reach a human looking at the
 * screen; roster and identity migrations run by an agent reach this setting with
 * no notice anywhere in their path, so the warnings below go to `warnAgent` and
 * surface in the conversation that ordered the repoint.
 *
 * Lives in its own module because `auto-join-domain` and `accept-pending` are
 * imported by `context`, so hosting this in `context` would make the cycle.
