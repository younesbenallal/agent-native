/**
 * Widen pre-existing 32-bit `integer` columns to 64-bit `BIGINT` in place on
 * Postgres.
 *
 * Several stores historically created millisecond-timestamp columns (e.g.
 * `agent_runs.started_at`, `application_state.updated_at`) as a literal
 * `INTEGER`. On Postgres that is int4 (max 2,147,483,647), so a millisecond
 * epoch such as 1782269273204 overflows with:
 *   `value "1782269273204" is out of range for type integer`
 * The CREATE TABLE source was later switched to `BIGINT`,
 * but `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot re-type a column that already
 * exists, so long-lived databases keep the int4 column and every write
 * into it fails. Migrations now use `BIGINT` directly; this helper covers
 * tables created by older raw `ensureTable()` definitions.
 *
 * This widens such columns once, then no-ops: it only ALTERs columns whose
 * current type is `integer`, so already-bigint tables are never rewritten.
 * Widening int4 → int8 is additive and non-destructive (no data loss, no
 * narrowing), so it is safe to run unconditionally on every boot.
 *
 * Call from a store's `ensureTable()` right after its `CREATE TABLE IF NOT
 * EXISTS`, passing the millisecond-timestamp columns for that table. Pass the
 * UNQUALIFIED table name (the lookup is scoped to the `public` schema); the
 * `ALTER` resolves the table through the search path.
