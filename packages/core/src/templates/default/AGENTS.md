# {{APP_NAME}} — Agent Guide

This is an agent-native app: the UI and agent share SQL state and the same
action surface. Use the app's existing patterns before adding new ones.

## Skills

Read the matching skill before implementation.
Before building common workspace or agent UI, read `agent-native-toolkit`
and `customizing-agent-native` for the configure → compose → eject ladder. Start with `actions` for app operations, `storing-data`
for persistence, `real-time-sync` for live updates, and `security` for auth,
access, and secrets. Use `adding-a-feature` for cross-cutting work and
`self-modifying-code` when changing app source.

## Agent discovery

List the app's key actions once in an `## Actions` table here. MCP/WebMCP key
tools come from `mcp.keyToolNames ?? initialToolNames`; the table may list
more, but both must agree on the key ones and name only real actions. See
`actions` (Return Values), `context-awareness` (Selection state), and
`external-agents`.

## Core rules

- UI feedback: target 100 ms, never exceed 400 ms; acknowledge before network work.
- Store structured state in SQL through Drizzle; store large files in
  configured file/blob storage and persist only URLs, ids, or opaque handles.
- Normal app data must flow through actions.
- Do not create `/api/*` routes that only call, repackage, or proxy an action.
- Define app operations with `defineAction` in `actions/`. The agent and UI
  call the same action surface; don't duplicate an action with a JSON route.
- If you are about to add `server/routes/api/`, write an action instead,
  except for uploads, streaming, webhooks, OAuth callbacks, public
  unauthenticated URLs, or non-JSON responses.
- Keep database code PostgreSQL-specific and migrations additive. Don't use
  adapter-only database methods or production schema push commands.
- All AI work goes through agent chat. UI/server code must not call models or
  hide multi-step AI in one action. Keep actions deterministic and focused;
  use the AgentSidebar for research and follow-ups in the same thread.
- Keep domain workflows on named routes and preserve the scaffold's full-page
  chat route. Use the right AgentSidebar for contextual AI and open it when a
  domain button hands work to the agent.
- Keep first viewport focused: one primary action, progressive disclosure,
  concise copy, no generic Chat; never use sparkle, wand, magic, or robot icons.
- Page and section data loads use layout-matching `Skeleton` geometry, never a
  generic "Loading..." label. Reserve `Spinner` for brief mutations and
  progress actions.
- Use a sans-first hierarchy with one restrained cue; reserve serif for previews.
  Give AgentSidebar a subtle boundary; stack original/generated review vertically.
- Before visual work, read `frontend-design` and fill in `DESIGN.md` (product
  mode, visual direction, palette, type, composition, anti-references).
  Preserve existing brand tokens; don't default to warm beige plus terracotta
  or copy a sibling app's accent.
- Every AI-labeled button must call `sendToAgentChat()` with
  `openSidebar: true`; label deterministic local actions as local or preview.
- Keep application state in SQL so the agent can read navigation, selection,
  and focused-object context.
- Never hardcode keys, tokens, webhook URLs, private data, or credential-like
  literals. Use secrets, OAuth, or obvious placeholders.
- For external integrations, inspect the workspace/provider connection catalog
  first. Reuse an existing connection and its scoped resolver; use app-local
  vault/OAuth/settings only when no reusable connection exists.
- A missing or unreadable value must stay distinguishable from success. Throw
  or return an explicit error instead of falling back to an empty value.

## Public and private routes

`app/routes/_index.tsx` document-redirects to the shared `/sign-in` page. Keep
authenticated app UI and data loads under `/home` or another private route.

## Lightweight defaults

Apps are English-only and do not generate changelog entries by default. If an
app needs more locales or user-facing release notes, opt in from
`agent-native.config.ts`:

```ts
import { defineAgentNativeConfig } from "@agent-native/core";

export default defineAgentNativeConfig({
  translations: { locales: ["en-US", "fr-FR"] },
  changelog: { enabled: true },
});
```

## Application state

Use the existing `application_state` helpers for navigation and selection.
Keep the shape small: current route/view and the selected object id.

## Actions

Actions in `actions/` are callable from the agent, UI hooks, HTTP, MCP, A2A,
and CLI where enabled. Validate inputs with Zod, return structured data, and
scope reads and writes to the signed-in user or organization. Prefer
`useActionQuery` and `useActionMutation` in browser code.

## Authentication and access

Auth is real Better Auth in dev and prod. Use `getSession()` or the shared
request context and fail closed when there is no session. Never use a
sentinel identity such as `local@localhost`. Tables with ownable columns need
scoped reads and writes through the framework access helpers.

## UI and sync

Use the shared toolkit and shadcn primitives for standard controls. Keep UI
optimistic where safe, roll back failed mutations, and use `useDbSync()` or
action query invalidation to reflect agent writes without a manual refresh.

## Documentation lookup

Version-matched docs and source examples ship with `@agent-native/core`. Use
`pnpm action docs-search --query "<topic>"` and
`pnpm action source-search --query "<pattern>"`; read the relevant skill
before relying on a framework API. Never edit `node_modules` or deep-import
package internals.

## Verification

Match checks to the change: run the existing focused tests, typecheck, and
formatter. Add a changelog entry only when `changelog.enabled` is true.
