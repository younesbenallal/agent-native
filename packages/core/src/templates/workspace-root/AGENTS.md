# {{APP_TITLE}} Workspace Instructions

These instructions apply at the workspace root. App-specific behavior belongs
in `apps/<app>/AGENTS.md`; shared cross-app behavior belongs in
`packages/shared/AGENTS.md` or `packages/shared/.agents/skills/`.
The root `.agents/skills` path points at the shared package's skills so local
coding agents can discover the same workspace-wide guidance from the root.

The inherited skill set is intentionally small: actions, data, security,
secrets, sync, shared UI, agent delegation, and workspace conventions. Skills
for feature flags, translations, changelogs, providers, automations, release
workflows, and other specialized work are opt-in. Add an optional skill to the
workspace core or the app that needs it; do not copy it into every app.

## Framework Docs Lookup

Version-matched Agent-Native docs ship with `@agent-native/core` in
`node_modules/@agent-native/core/docs`. A source-only corpus of first-party
template patterns ships in `node_modules/@agent-native/core/corpus`.

- From an app directory, use `pnpm action docs-search --query "<topic>"`,
  `pnpm action docs-search --slug <slug>`, or `pnpm action docs-search --list`.
  Use `pnpm action source-search --query "<pattern>"` or
  `pnpm action source-search --path <path>` when source examples matter.
- From the workspace root, read `node_modules/@agent-native/core/docs/AGENTS.md`
  and search `node_modules/@agent-native/core/docs/content/` directly with `rg`.
  Search `node_modules/@agent-native/core/corpus/` for template source examples
  and `node_modules/@agent-native/core/dist/` for framework internals.
- For advanced workspace features, start with `workspace`, `multi-app-workspace`,
  `a2a-protocol`, `pure-agent-apps`, `automations`, `recurring-jobs`,
  `external-agents`, `mcp-protocol`, `sharing`, and `security`. These are
  optional skills; read them only when the app or workspace uses that feature.

Use package docs for framework APIs, the package corpus for reusable
template patterns, and `packages/shared/AGENTS.md` plus
`packages/shared/.agents/skills/` for workspace-specific conventions.
Before building common workspace or agent UI, read `agent-native-toolkit` to
inventory existing public kits and installed package seams. Read
`customizing-agent-native` before adapting shared UI. Use the supported
ladder: configure → compose → eject the smallest unit → propose a shared seam.
Preview before `--apply`, commit `agent-native.ejections.json`, and never edit
`node_modules` or eject protected runtime contracts.
To bring an older workspace current, run `pnpm upgrade:agent-native` or
`npx @agent-native/core@latest upgrade` from the workspace root. That bumps
`@agent-native/*` deps, installs, refreshes scaffold skills, and typechecks.
Do **not** run `pnpm patch` / `pnpm patch-commit`, add
`pnpm.patchedDependencies`, commit dependency patches, or edit
`node_modules/@agent-native/*` when an upgrade fails — fix app code or ask.
See the `upgrade-agent-native` and `self-modifying-code` skills.
After a manual core bump only, `pnpm skills:update` (or
`npx @agent-native/core@latest skills update scaffold --project`) still
refreshes framework-provided shared skills and repairs `CLAUDE.md` /
`.claude/skills` compatibility links.

## Lightweight defaults

- UI feedback: target 100 ms, never exceed 400 ms; acknowledge before network work.
New apps use English as the source locale and do not generate changelog
entries. To opt into additional translations or changelog generation, edit
`agent-native.config.ts` at the workspace root:

```ts
import { defineAgentNativeConfig } from "@agent-native/core";

export default defineAgentNativeConfig({
  translations: { locales: ["en-US", "es-ES"] },
  changelog: { enabled: true },
});
```

An app-local config can override the workspace policy when only one app needs
an additional locale or changelog.

## Core Agent Rule

- All AI/LLM behavior goes through the app's agent chat. UI and server code
  must not call model providers, AI SDK `generateText()` / `streamText()`, or
  other inline LLM APIs directly. Use `sendToAgentChat()` for local app-agent
  work, including hidden `context` and `submit: false` prefill/review flows.
  Keep actions deterministic and focused. If a workflow is framed as research,
  analysis, generation, recommendation, or synthesis, use
  `sendToAgentChat({ openSidebar: true })` to open the AgentSidebar and let the
  agent orchestrate its provider/data actions. Keep follow-ups in the same
  thread, not a second freeform textbox.
  Only use `useAgentChatContext`, `setAgentChatContextItem`,
  `listAgentChatContext`, `removeAgentChatContextItem`, and
  `clearAgentChatContext` when UI needs two-way sync with staged context chips.
  Read `packages/shared/.agents/skills/delegate-to-agent/SKILL.md` before
  building agent-driven UI or "AI" features.

## Agent Surface

- Keep domain workflows on named routes and preserve the scaffold's full-page
  chat route. Use the right `AgentSidebar` for contextual AI and open it when a
  domain button hands work to the agent.
- Keep the first viewport focused: one primary action, progressive disclosure,
  concise copy, and domain-specific navigation. Never use sparkle, wand,
  magic, or robot icons as AI affordances.
- Page and section data loads use layout-matching `Skeleton` geometry, never a
  generic "Loading..." label. Reserve `Spinner` for brief mutations, uploads,
  and progress actions.
- Use a sans-first SaaS hierarchy with one restrained visual cue; reserve serif
  type for content previews. Give the AgentSidebar a subtle surface/divider
  boundary, and stack original/generated review vertically by default.
- Every AI-labeled button must call `sendToAgentChat()` with
  `openSidebar: true`; label deterministic local actions as local or preview.
- Before visual work, read `frontend-design` and `DESIGN.md`. Shared workspace
  chrome stays semantic and neutral; each app chooses a named visual direction
  and palette family rather than inheriting the last app's accent.

## Workspace Resources

- The Workspace files view is for user-authored or user-requested resources
  they intentionally add, edit, or manage.
- Agents may use hidden `agent_scratch` resources for temporary working notes,
  scripts, task plans, or intermediate outputs. Keep those scratch files hidden
  by default and promote them only when the user explicitly asks to keep or
  manage the file.
- Durable instructions, skills, jobs, memories, custom agents, and files the
  user explicitly asked to save belong in normal workspace visibility.
- Runtime-editable global resources are managed from Dispatch Resources. Use
  `AGENTS.md` or `instructions/<slug>.md` for always-on guardrails,
  `skills/<slug>/SKILL.md` for workspace skills, `context/<slug>.md` for
  personas/positioning/messaging/company facts/brand guidelines, and
  `agents/<slug>.md` for custom agent profiles.
- Set Dispatch resources to All apps when every workspace app should inherit
  them. Use selected-app grants only for resources that should not be global.

## Workspace Scope

- Scale effort to the task. A small, well-specified change is a short read, the
  edit, and the existing checks — not a codebase survey, unrequested tests, or
  browser automation.
- Keep root changes focused on workspace orchestration, shared configuration,
  deploy settings, and monorepo tooling.
- Keep application routes, actions, server plugins, and app state inside the
  relevant `apps/<app>` directory unless multiple apps need the same behavior.
- Put reusable code in `packages/shared` only after at least two apps need it.
- SQL is for structured records, metadata, references, and searchable text. Store
  large files/blob payloads (base64, `data:` URLs, images, video/audio, PDFs,
  ZIPs, screenshots, thumbnails, session replay chunks) in configured file/blob
  storage and persist only URLs, ids, or handles.
- Never copy live credentials, API keys, tokens, webhook URLs, signing secrets,
  personal email addresses, customer data, private Builder/internal data, or
  company-specific placeholder values into source files, docs, prompts,
  fixtures, application state, action responses, or generated app content. Use
  secrets/OAuth/runtime configuration and obvious placeholders in examples.

## New Workspace Apps

- When a user asks from Dispatch chat or by tagging `@agent-native` in Slack to
  create, build, make, scaffold, or generate an "agent", classify the ask
  first. Simple Dispatch-native behavior such as a reminder, digest, monitor,
  routing rule, saved instruction, or recurring workflow can stay in Dispatch
  as a recurring job/resource/destination. Robust unique products or teammates
  that need their own UI, data model, actions, integrations, or domain workflow
  should become a separate workspace app under `apps/<app-id>`, mounted at
  `/<app-id>`.
- When a user explicitly asks for a new app or workspace app, create the
  separate workspace app.
- For composable workflows, prefer many one-job headless or small-UI apps that
  discover and call sibling apps over A2A. Read
  `packages/shared/.agents/skills/composable-mini-apps/SKILL.md` before
  designing cross-app orchestration.
- Dispatch vault access is workspace-wide by default: every saved vault key is
  available to every workspace app. Only create or request per-app vault grants
  when Dispatch's vault access setting is switched to manual mode.
- Before implementing an app that connects to an external service, inspect the
  workspace/provider connection catalog first. Reuse an existing connection and
  its scoped credential resolver; only then use shared settings, vault, OAuth,
  onboarding, and provider API primitives for app-local setup.
- Keep custom setup UI only for provider-specific prerequisites, sequencing,
  readiness, or health checks. It must link to or call shared settings/OAuth and
  action surfaces, not duplicate credential storage or transport. Model one
  logical connection as one onboarding outcome instead of marking every field
  required by reflex.
- When an app needs a provider credential, read it through the framework's
  scoped secret or workspace-connection resolver so the Dispatch vault remains
  the source of truth. Framework apps should use `resolveSecret` from
  `@agent-native/core/server`; workspace repos with a connector helper should
  use that helper. Do not ask a non-admin builder to add a key to local project
  settings or `.env`; request a missing key through Dispatch's vault workflow
  instead.
- Do not satisfy a new-app request by adding a route, page, component, or file
  to `apps/chat` or another existing app unless the user explicitly asks to
  modify that existing app.
- Treat first-party apps such as Mail, Calendar, Analytics, Brain, Assets, and Dispatch as
  existing hosted/connected neighbors available through links and A2A/default
  connected agents. For example, Mail, Calendar, Analytics, Brain, and Assets already exist at
  `https://mail.agent-native.com`, `https://calendar.agent-native.com`, and
  `https://analytics.agent-native.com`, `https://brain.agent-native.com`, and
  `https://assets.agent-native.com`.
- If a new app needs to use Mail, Calendar, Analytics, Brain, Assets, or similar first-party
  data/agents, build only the genuinely new workflow and delegate/link to those
  existing apps. Do not create wrapper apps, child apps, nested template copies,
  or cloned Mail/Calendar/Analytics/Brain/Assets implementations inside the new app just to
  provide access.
- Only create a first-party app copy when the user explicitly asks for a
  customized fork/copy of that app. Otherwise prefer the hosted/shared app so
  base template improvements continue to flow automatically.
- Workspace apps are discovered from `apps/<app-id>/package.json`. There is no
  separate workspace app registry to edit for Dispatch to list the app.
- Always save a concise, human-readable `description` in the generated app's
  `apps/<app-id>/package.json`. Dispatch lists and A2A connected-agent context
  use the app name plus this description so other agents understand what the app
  does. Dispatch users can later edit the displayed name/description from the
  Apps page without changing source.
- All sibling workspace apps are accessible by default over A2A through
  `call-agent`. Agents receive a compact list of available app names and
  descriptions in prompt context; use tool search or app-specific actions only
  when more detail is needed.
- Use relative workspace links like `/<app-id>`. Never hardcode
  `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `8080`, `8100`, or any dev port in app cards,
  instructions, redirects, or navigation; the active workspace gateway/browser
  origin owns the port.
- React Router apps must preserve `APP_BASE_PATH` / `VITE_APP_BASE_PATH` in
  `app/entry.client.tsx` via `appBasePath()` so the app hydrates correctly
  when mounted at `/<app-id>`.
- Use the framework/template UI stack for standard UI: shadcn/ui components and
  `@tabler/icons-react`. Do not add `lucide-react` or another icon library.
  Read `packages/shared/.agents/skills/shadcn-ui/SKILL.md` before adding,
  updating, or debugging shadcn components.
- Normal app data must flow through actions. For CRUD that the agent can
  perform, create `defineAction` files in `actions/`, mark reads with
  `http: { method: "GET" }`, and call them from React with `useActionQuery` /
  `useActionMutation`. Do not add duplicate JSON CRUD routes under `/api/*`
  for the same data unless the route is for uploads, streaming, webhooks,
  OAuth, or another route-only concern. Do not add routes whose main job is to
  wrap, proxy, or re-export an action; the action endpoint already exists at
  `/_agent-native/actions/:name`. If you are about to create a file under
  `server/routes/api/`, or middleware to guard one, stop and write a
  `defineAction` instead. Action-backed UI is what makes agent-created
  or agent-edited records appear without a manual refresh.
- App database code is PostgreSQL-specific. Define schemas with
  `@agent-native/core/db/schema` helpers and write app reads/writes with
  Drizzle's query builder and PostgreSQL operators. Keep raw SQL for additive
  migrations, health checks, or carefully scoped maintenance. Do
  not use SQL as object storage; file bytes belong in upload/private-blob
  providers with only references saved to app tables.
- In local development, scaffold the app from the workspace root with
  `pnpm exec agent-native create <app-id> --template=<template>`. In production
  Dispatch posts the request to Builder branch creation; the Builder branch
  should still create the separate workspace app, not patch chat. The local
  workspace gateway detects new app directories automatically and starts each
  app server lazily on first visit.
- Before telling the user the app is created, request `/<app-id>` on the
  running gateway and confirm it serves the new app, not a fallback route or
  another app's shell, then tell the user that exact path to open — the
  preview root can still show a different app. Never report the app as
  created while the preview still shows something else.
- If the preview/host isn't running the workspace gateway (root `pnpm dev`),
  say plainly that its run/dev command must point at the workspace root
  `pnpm dev` and name where to set it (Builder: project settings → dev
  command); the agent cannot change a host's run/dev command itself.
- When using the chat template, treat it as scaffolding only. The finished
  app must be branded as the requested app, with its own home screen,
  navigation, package metadata, manifest, and domain workflow. Do not leave
  visible `Chat`, `Starter`, `Blank app`, `Start building`, or `New app` UI in
  a chat-derived app.

## Workspace Identity

Use the workspace root `.env` for shared identity and cross-app trust settings:

- `WORKSPACE_ORG_NAME` — human-readable organization name.
- `WORKSPACE_ORG_DOMAIN` — bare domain owned by the workspace, with no protocol
  or path.
- `WORKSPACE_OWNER_EMAIL` — initial owner/admin email for repairs and
  integration defaults.
- `A2A_SECRET` — shared secret for cross-app A2A signing. Generate with
  `openssl rand -hex 32` and configure through your deployment/scoped secret
  manager.

`DISPATCH_DEFAULT_OWNER_EMAIL` is optional. Set it only for trusted,
single-workspace deployments where unlinked integration requests should run as
the workspace owner, and prefer the same value as `WORKSPACE_OWNER_EMAIL`.

## Org Repair

When asked to repair workspace org or A2A configuration:

1. Read `.env` first. Do not infer the organization, domain, owner email, or
   secret from old examples.
2. Run `pnpm repair:workspace-org -- --name "<org>" --domain example.com --owner-email owner@example.com`
   to validate generic workspace identity values without writing `.env`.
3. Prefer the app's organization settings UI or authenticated org routes for
   changing `allowed_domain` and `a2a_secret`.
4. If direct SQL is unavoidable, inspect the live schema first and use only
   parameterized `INSERT` or `UPDATE` statements. Ensure the target org has
   `organizations.name`, `organizations.allowed_domain`,
   `organizations.a2a_secret`, and an `org_members` owner row for
   `WORKSPACE_OWNER_EMAIL`.
5. Never use `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`, destructive `ALTER`, or an unscoped
   `DELETE`. Do not rotate `A2A_SECRET` without updating every app that trusts
   it.
