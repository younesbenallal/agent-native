## 0.164.9

### Patch Changes

- b1c420b: Block agent prompts until an LLM provider is connected and provide an inline Connect AI recovery flow with a clear retry action.
- 8690e40: Make automation details inspectable in Dispatch, including the prompt, trigger configuration, capabilities, and past runs.
- e542242: Create every framework-owned table at release time, so a hosted deploy comes up with a complete database.

  Most framework tables are defined by their owning store's `ensureTable()`, not by a migration list — `settings`, `application_state`, `app_secrets` and `resources` among them. On a long-lived server the first request creates whatever is missing. On production serverless it cannot: `schemaEnsureDisabled()` reports every table present so a cold start skips ~390 probes, which is correct for latency and means nothing on the request path can create a table. Only 15 of ~75 framework tables had a migration list, so the other 60 had no path to creation at all on a hosted deploy. Sites published successfully and then failed every request with `relation "public.settings" does not exist`.

  `runFrameworkReleaseMigrations` now runs those stores' own ensure paths first, from an explicit list in `server/release-schema.ts`, and `schemaEnsureDisabled()` no longer applies to a caller holding migration duty — the release step was subject to its own skip, because the Netlify build environment also sets `NETLIFY=true`.

  The list loads each store with a dynamic import, so re-exporting `runFrameworkReleaseMigrations` from `server/index.ts` does not pull 60 store modules into every server boot to serve a path that runs once.

  A new `guard:release-schema-complete` fails the build when a module creates tables and is not in that list, so a new store cannot repeat this. It recognises both `ensureTableExists` and stores that execute DDL held in a named constant, which is how `extensions/slots` created its tables without the first version of the guard seeing it. The migration-duty check moved to `db/migration-runtime.ts` to keep it off `db/client.js`, which stores mock.

  Already-published sites need one redeploy to pick up the missing tables.

## 0.164.5

### Patch Changes

- fc85cb2: Bind desktop Google OAuth exchanges to a high-entropy verifier so a known flow ID alone cannot retrieve a session token.

  Previously `/_agent-native/auth/desktop-exchange` returned a live session token to any caller that named the flow ID, and the flow ID came straight from the query string. An attacker could pick an ID, send someone to `/_agent-native/google/auth-url?desktop=1&flow_id=<known>&redirect=1`, then poll the exchange after that person signed in and receive their session token. The verifier now travels in an `X-Agent-Native-Desktop-Verifier` request header — which a link navigation cannot set — only its hash is stored, and the exchange read fails closed when the verifier is missing or does not match.

  **Desktop clients must be upgraded.** The old `GET ?desktop=1&flow_id=…` bootstrap is rejected, because that request shape is exactly what made the exchange stealable; there is no backward-compatible variant that keeps the fix. An older independently deployed desktop client will fail Google sign-in with `Invalid desktop exchange challenge.` until it ships the header-based bootstrap.

- fc85cb2: Stop treating an unreadable code-agent schedules file as an empty schedule list. A transient read error, a corrupt file, or a partially-written `schedules.json` collapsed to `[]`, and because every create/update/delete rewrites the whole file, the next mutation silently deleted every stored schedule. Only a genuinely absent file initializes as empty now; anything unreadable raises `CodeAgentSchedulesUnreadableError` and mutations refuse to run.

## 0.164.0

### Minor Changes

- a2f21dc: Add an internal beta/production environment badge and typed deployment-lane metadata to hosted Agent-Native app shells.

### Patch Changes

- a2f21dc: Fix `useActionQuery`/`useActionMutation`/`callAction` surfacing an opaque `405` when a caller's HTTP verb doesn't match an action's declared `http.method` (e.g. a `defineAction({ http: { method: "DELETE" } })` called without `{ method: "DELETE" }`). The transport now throws a typed `action_method_mismatch` error naming the action, the method that was sent, and the method it declares, instead of a bare "Method not allowed" the caller had to reverse-engineer — and marks it non-retryable, since resending the same wrong verb never succeeds.
- a2f21dc: Show Approve/Deny again when a tool approval has to be re-asked. `approval_required` now carries an `askId` identifying that specific gate hit, and the chat retains a user's resolution per ask instead of per approval key. Previously, if a resume never consumed the grant (expired TTL, turn-id mismatch), the server re-asked for the same call and the client still showed the quiet "Approved" note — the buttons never came back, so the action silently never ran and there was no way to retry.
- a2f21dc: Improve locale picker labels and localized auth marketing copy.
- a2f21dc: Stop caller-supplied auth marketing from being overwritten by built-in localized copy. An app passing its own `marketing` whose `appName` matched a built-in slug (`Dispatch`, `Calendar`, …) had its tagline and features replaced by the stock localized copy in every non-English locale. A slug is now claimed only by content that actually matches the built-in entry.
- a2f21dc: Fix a bug where closing one chat tab could close several tabs at once (or make a tab reappear right after closing it). A duplicated thread id made two tab-bar entries share one underlying thread, so closing either removed both. Open-tab ids are now de-duplicated in the tab state itself, which covers both a corrupted list restored from localStorage and duplicates introduced at runtime by a synchronous burst of open requests.
- a2f21dc: Keep semantic settings URLs under the app's mounted workspace path.
- a2f21dc: Fix Connect Builder (and other `agentNativePath`/`appPath` calls) building the wrong URL in a multi-app workspace dev gateway when the current page's client-side route (e.g. `/settings`) isn't itself a workspace app id. Previously `appBasePath()` would blindly trust the URL's first path segment as the workspace mount, producing URLs like `/settings/_agent-native/builder/connect` that the gateway 404s into its app-picker page instead of Builder's real sign-in screen. The guessed segment is now validated against the deployed workspace app manifest when one is available.
- a2f21dc: Extend the human-in-the-loop tool approval grant window from 15 minutes to 1 hour. A user who stepped away between seeing an "Approve to run..." prompt and clicking it (e.g. to update their client) could return to a silently expired grant — clicking Approve did nothing because the durable row no longer matched `expires_at > now`, with no error shown.
- a2f21dc: Add regression coverage proving the magic-link `callbackURL`/`newUserCallbackURL` construction survives Better Auth's own `originCheck` validator end-to-end (not just a shape assertion) — this is the exact flow behind the `{"message":"Invalid callbackURL","code":"INVALID_CALLBACK_URL"}` reports from a UTM-tagged signup link and a retried sign-up after a stale `?error=` redirect. The existing absolute-URL promotion in `betterAuthCallbackURL` already fixed the underlying behavior; this closes the test gap so a future regression is caught even if the constructed URL still "looks" valid.

  Also stop silently swallowing a failure in the best-effort `email_verified` repair that runs after a successful verify-email redirect. A DB error there was previously indistinguishable from "nothing needed repairing," which is exactly the symptom in the "clicked the verify link, login still says not verified" reports — it's now reported via `captureAuthError` (still non-blocking) so a genuine failure is visible instead of silent.

- a2f21dc: Fix two bugs where a failure looked like success:
  - First-run onboarding's Skip/Continue no longer silently do nothing when the completion save fails. `completeFirstRun()` now rejects instead of swallowing a failed fetch or non-ok response, and `FirstRunOnboarding` surfaces the failure with a "Try again" affordance instead of bouncing to an unrelated full-screen error.
  - A workspace file (including binary exports) now renders a download card the moment it's created — `show-workspace-file`'s binary content-type gate is gone, and any tool result shaped like a workspace-file card (e.g. `web-request`/`provider-api-request`'s `saveToFile`) renders one automatically, without a second discretionary `show-workspace-file` call.

- a2f21dc: Keep replayed conversations faithful to what the agent actually did.
  - Resuming a run (chained background continuation, agent-teams `continue`) now
    replays the tool calls and results stored in `thread_data` instead of
    flattening each turn to its prose, so a resumed chunk can see the output of
    work already committed rather than re-running it. Integration turns keep their
    existing delivered-text-only replay policy, and each replayed result is bounded
    with an in-band truncation notice.
  - The outbound history window no longer slides by one message per turn. Every
    prompt cache matches a byte-identical prefix, so a window that moved every turn
    meant no cached prefix ever matched once a thread passed the message cap, and
    the whole conversation was re-billed at write price on every turn. The window
    start is now quantized to a stride.
  - Anthropic `redacted_thinking` blocks survive normalization and replay verbatim.
    They were silently dropped as an unknown block type, which left the next
    iteration of a tool-use turn sending an assistant turn the API rejects.
    Unrecognized content block types now warn instead of vanishing.
  - Reducing a long thread is Observational Memory's job, but its Observer only
    engages past 30k unobserved tokens while a 24-message count cap bit long
    before that, so turns left the request while compaction still had nothing to
    say about them. The count cap is now a backstop well above that threshold; the
    two char budgets remain the real bound on what a request carries.
  - A thinking block with no signature is dropped with a warning instead of being
    sent with an empty one, which the native API rejects outright — failing the
    whole turn on a provider error that points nowhere near the cause. The Builder
    gateway path is unchanged, since its tolerance here is unverified.

- a2f21dc: Retry a failed chat request automatically after the user connects an LLM provider from the recovery card, instead of leaving the request waiting behind a dismissed error.
- a2f21dc: Fix `provider-api-request` reporting a failed Slack send as a success. Slack's Web API always answers HTTP 200, even on failure, and encodes the real outcome as `ok: false` in the JSON body — `chat.postMessage` calls that failed (e.g. `not_in_channel`, `channel_not_found`, `msg_too_long`) looked identical to a delivered message to any caller checking `response.ok`, including the agent, which could then tell a user a Slack message was sent when it never was. Provider configs can now declare `bodyOkField` for this always-200-with-body-encoded-outcome convention; the Slack provider sets it, and a body-level `false` now flips the response's `ok` to `false` so a failed or unconfirmed send can no longer be reported as delivered.
- a2f21dc: Record a rejected Builder credential on the transcription path so it is not
  retried forever. The chat engine already marks a 401/403 and stops reusing that
  credential for the auth-failure TTL; transcription threw the raw upstream text
  and marked nothing, so one unusable credential re-sent the same doomed request
  on every attempt — 24 identical "Missing Authentication header" 401s in a day.

- bcd4c14: Time out session-replay uploads so a hung request releases the flush lock instead of growing the replay queue for the rest of the session, and bound the extension-marker scan by its watermark instead of reading every marker row ever written.
- 0b57293: Add regression coverage proving the magic-link `callbackURL`/`newUserCallbackURL` construction survives Better Auth's own `originCheck` validator end-to-end (not just a shape assertion) — this is the exact flow behind the `{"message":"Invalid callbackURL","code":"INVALID_CALLBACK_URL"}` reports from a UTM-tagged signup link and a retried sign-up after a stale `?error=` redirect.

- 814f0ad: Allow explicitly configured public ingestion routes to complete cross-origin preflight requests without enabling credentialed CORS.
- c54d918: `useSemanticNavigationState` no longer reports an unserializable navigation state
  once per render. The write-dedup token fell back to a fresh symbol, and
  `navigationKeys` is typically a new array each render, so every re-render issued
  another failing write and another `onError`. It now falls back to the state's own
  identity, which still lets a genuinely different unserializable state reach the
  write path and surface its real error.

## 0.161.18

### Patch Changes

- 9dd50a0: Drop JSON Schema keywords OpenAI's function validator rejects: unsupported
  `format` values (`uri` from `z.string().url()` among them) and constraint-only
  keywords like `patternProperties`, `not`, and `if`/`then`/`else`. Any one of them
  400s the entire chat request, so a single `z.string().url()` in one tool broke
  every turn that offered it.
- f294ae3: Keep the Connect Builder and Custom keys actions side by side in the agent sidebar.

## 0.161.17

### Patch Changes

- 34496d7: Sanitize every tool schema at the engine boundary, not just `defineAction` ones.
  Hand-written tools (extensions, MCP, context tools) and third-party MCP server
  schemas bypassed the sanitizer entirely, so `extension-data-set` shipped a `data`
  property with no `type` and OpenAI 400'd the whole request — every tool in the
  payload, not just that one.

## 0.161.16

### Patch Changes

- c940f4c: Record a rejected Builder credential on the transcription path so it is not
  retried forever. The chat engine already marks a 401/403 and stops reusing that

## 0.161.15

### Patch Changes

- 551b583: Fix `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` exact-match comparison to tolerate operator formatting differences (scheme/host casing, a trailing slash, or a bare domain with no scheme) instead of silently rejecting an otherwise-legitimate configured origin.
- 551b583: Stop sending unbounded inline base64 attachments to the model. Text attachments
  were capped; binary ones were not, so a large screenshot or PDF went out as a
  multi-megabyte `file_url` and OpenAI rejected the entire request ("string too
  long", 4,149,128 against a 1,048,576 limit), killing the turn. The upload to
  blob storage already happened — the hosted URL is now used in place of the bytes
  when they exceed the cap, instead of being discarded.
- 00025b1: Keep replayed conversations faithful to what the agent actually did.
  - Resuming a run (chained background continuation, agent-teams `continue`) now
    replays the tool calls and results stored in `thread_data` instead of
    flattening each turn to its prose, so a resumed chunk can see the output of
    work already committed rather than re-running it. Integration turns keep their
    existing delivered-text-only replay policy, and each replayed result is bounded
    with an in-band truncation notice.
  - The outbound history window no longer slides by one message per turn. Every

- 96ecc13: Give type-less tool-schema positions a concrete JSON value union. OpenAI rejects
  any schema position without a `type` ("schema must have a 'type' key") and 400s
  the entire chat request, the same way it rejected `oneOf`. Zod emits a bare `{}`
  for `z.unknown()`/`z.any()`, of which there are 137 sites across the templates,
  so this is answered at the same boundary rather than by retyping every action.

## 0.161.12

### Patch Changes

- 610103f: Page owners and admins when an app's chat stops answering. The detector already
  existed as `scripts/chat-health.mjs --strict`, but nothing ran it and nothing
  alerted, so a sustained outage was found by a user posting in Slack. The same
  turn-scoring now runs on the durable sweep that already drives stale reaping,
  scoped to the app it runs in so no cross-app credential is needed. "Not enough
  turns to judge" and "could not read the ledger" are distinct outcomes from
  "healthy" — a check that could not run never reports all-clear.
- 610103f: Rewrite `oneOf` to `anyOf` in generated tool schemas. OpenAI's function-calling
  validator rejects `oneOf` outright, and Zod v4 emits it for every
  `z.discriminatedUnion`, so a single action carrying one 400'd the entire chat
  request before any token streamed — every tool in the payload, not just that
  action. Measured at 178k errors across 786 users over seven weeks. Also stops a
  settings-read failure in the chat-health pager from reading as "never paged".
- 2a7736a: Bound realtime polling, invalidation, collaboration, and autoscroll work so idle or rapidly changing surfaces do not retain unbounded state or repeat expensive refreshes.

- 3c54d4e: Add `setAgentNativeApiDisabled(reason)` for surfaces framed by a host with no
  agent-native session, so the client stops calling `/_agent-native/*` instead of
  401-ing on every poll. Action queries do not fire, action fetches and
  application-state reads/writes throw `AgentNativeApiDisabledError`, session reads
  resolve as signed out, and the runtime-config ping is skipped.
- 3c54d4e: `sendToBuilderChat` accepts a `targetOrigin` for embedders that verified the
  Builder parent through a handshake. `getBuilderParentOrigin()` requires
  `?builder.*` params to trust a loopback parent, so those embeds previously fell
  back to posting `"*"`.

### Patch Changes

- ff06749: fix stale home chat pointers so a missing local thread does not render a restore error
- ff06749: fix mounted embed dev servers serving CSS and other static assets through Vite's normal asset pipeline and allow Builder preview origins to use embed CORS
- c7ad22e: Fix Portal remote connector initialization so handoffs create remote run records and expose command failures in connector logs.
- ff06749: Record what was sent when an agent run errors. An errored run's capture now
  carries the failed request's model, payload bytes, tool count, and message
  count alongside `gatewayRequestId` — sizes and counts only, never prompt or
  user content — so an oversized request and an upstream outage stop producing
  identical, undiagnosable captures.
- ff06749: Stop a background turn from retrying an identical failure forever. When two
  consecutive server-driven continuation chunks end on the same terminal error
  code having produced no assistant text and no tool calls, the chain now stops
  and the run ends with one non-recoverable error that keeps the original error
  code and the gateway's `ERROR ID:` reference. A different error, or the same
  error after real progress, still chains as before.

### Patch Changes

- 772f59a: Allow token-authenticated remote device relay endpoints to reach their route-level device-token verifier.
- 772f59a: Distinguish a retryable app load failure from an app that is genuinely gone. The chat-first app pane's error branch fell back to `appUnavailable`, rendering "This workspace app is no longer available." above a Retry button.
- 772f59a: Bind workspace embed-session adoption to the existing target identity while allowing app-local organization ids.
- 772f59a: Prevent email security scanners from consuming Electron magic-link sign-ins before the user confirms them.
- 772f59a: Keep Electron magic-link verification behind an explicit POST confirmation so link scanners cannot consume the sign-in token.
- 772f59a: Verify confirmed desktop magic links in the confirmation request so the one-time session cookie reaches the native callback reliably.
- 772f59a: Add no-secret diagnostics around desktop magic-link issuance and verification so invalid-token failures can be isolated without logging the token.
- 772f59a: Keep the gateway request id on agent-chat error captures, and create the
  workspace connection tables at release time.

  A Builder gateway error stop often arrives as one opaque user-facing sentence
  carrying only an error id. The request id was captured only when the gateway
  sent no message at all, so the errors that actually page had no key to join on
  upstream. It now rides the stop event onto `EngineError` and out as a
  `gatewayRequestId` tag (alongside `statusCode`) on the run-manager capture.

  `workspace_connections`, `workspace_connection_grants`, and
  `workspace_user_groups` existed only in their runtime `ensureTable` helpers.
  Those are a no-op on a production serverless runtime by design, so
  `workspace_user_groups` was never created in production and every read failed
  with `relation "public.workspace_user_groups" does not exist`. They now have a
  release migration.

- 772f59a: Format the Portal reference table in the shared core documentation.
- 772f59a: Redact nested callback parameters in desktop magic-link diagnostics.
- 772f59a: Share the canonical localized authentication copy with native sign-in surfaces
  and allow authenticated packaged callers to mint workspace embed sessions.
- 772f59a: Keep approved agent actions valid across Dispatch history replay and scope them to the current turn.
- 772f59a: Add redacted diagnostics for desktop magic-link session-cookie handoff failures.

## 0.161.1

### Patch Changes

- 71e1308: Name the Builder gateway's unhandled-500 envelope instead of letting it end a
  turn as `unknown`.

  The gateway can answer 200 and then emit an in-stream error frame whose whole
  message is its own internal envelope ("Sorry, we ran into an issue processing
  your request. ERROR ID: …"), with no code and no status. That matched no
  classifier, so the turn died on the first attempt — no engine retry, no
  continuation, `error_code = 'unknown'` in `agent_runs`, and Builder's internal
  correlation id rendered as the assistant's answer. The identical body arriving
  as an HTTP 500 was always retried.

  `classifyTerminalErrorCode` now returns `builder_gateway_internal_error` for
  that envelope, the engine marks it `providerRetryable` so the verdict survives
  the Builder-credits message rewrite, and every predicate that lists `http_500`
  lists it too. The chat now shows what broke and keeps the error id in the
  details.

## 0.161.0

### Minor Changes

- 2107a36: Let a hosted app pay for its own AI with Builder credits. `BUILDER_GATEWAY_TOKEN`
  plus `BUILDER_GATEWAY_SPACE_ID` now select the Builder engine and back the
  gateway lane (chat, web search, realtime voice, transcription, scheduled and
  event automations), so an anonymous visitor can use AI on a deployed site
  without connecting anything. An injected gateway token can never move a
  customer's spend onto Builder credits: it steps aside for any other engine whose
  credentials resolve. A Builder key pair the customer configured themselves is
  unchanged and keeps winning, as does `AGENT_ENGINE_PREFER_BYO_KEY`. Where the
  deployment pays, a rejected or missing credential reads as one line to the
  visitor, with the real reason kept on the error code for the owner; that holds
  for the gateway's own 402/403 on voice and realtime transcription, for the auto
  provider chain rather than only an explicit Builder preference, for a gateway
  whose transport dropped or whose stream stopped early, and at the point the chat
  renders an error — where a message the deployment already chose for a visitor is
  no longer re-expanded from its code back into owner instructions. Owner surfaces
  keep the copy that says what to fix, the workspace/preview runtime included, even
  though it carries the same injected token as the published site. No recovery
  decision depends on what the error message says any more: the Builder engine
  marks a retryable gateway rejection and an over-long prompt structurally, and
  those verdicts reach the chat client too. So an overloaded provider retries the
  same way whoever is paying — without turning a provider throttle into a chain of
  background continuations against the limit that just rejected it — a truncated
  stream is still continued from where it stopped instead of ending the turn, and a
  conversation that outgrew the context window still gets its one automatic trim
  and retry. A background or
  scheduled run keeps the message the server chose for its failure rather than
  restating it from the terminal reason, and an earlier transient error in the same
  run can no longer stand in for the reason the run actually died. Pasted
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` values are now validated when saved.

## 0.159.0

### Minor Changes

- d003981: Add `defineAppConfig()` and `getAppConfig()` — one zod schema under `src/app-config/` that owns server-side configuration, so a value can be set in typed app code instead of only through an environment variable. Environment variables become declared `.meta({ env })` aliases into a schema field, parsed and validated in one place rather than at each call site, and resolve below explicit app configuration. A field can declare several aliases in precedence order, which is how one concept with many historical spellings collapses to a single declared ladder.

  Five domains are declared so far, replacing roughly thirty hand-rolled `process.env` reads:
  - **`privateBlob`** — `provider` selects which registered provider is active, replacing the implicit "first one whose `isConfigured()` returns true in module import order" rule (still the fallback when unset), and throwing when the named provider is not registered. `publicUploadFallback` replaces a setter and an environment variable whose precedence was decided by statement order inside `putPrivateBlob`. `setPrivateBlobPublicUploadFallbackEnabled` is deprecated but keeps working, now with a stated position in the ladder.
  - **`app`** — `id`, `workspaceId`, `name`, `packageName`, and `template` replace nine fallback chains across agent chat, SSO, credential scoping, onboarding, the CLI, data programs, durable background dispatch, and workspace OAuth. They stay separate fields on purpose: `vault_grants` rows are written with the workspace-assigned id, so credential scoping keeps preferring it, and `name` is a display name rather than an identifier. None has a default, so an app with no configured identity is still denied a credential grant lookup instead of resolving one scoped to an app literally named `app`.
  - **`agent`** — `engine`, `model`, `mode`, `preferBringYourOwnKey`, `runSoftTimeoutMs`, `completedRunRetentionMs`, `erroredRunRetentionMs`. `resolveEngine`'s documented resolution order is unchanged and `createAgentChatPlugin({ model })` keeps working; the explicit option stays a function parameter above the declared field.
  - **`a2a`** and **`integrations`** — `allowUnsignedInternal` and `allowUnverifiedWebhooks`, the latter replacing three byte-identical copies of the same check in the telegram, whatsapp, and email webhook adapters.
  - **`workspace`** — `gatewayUrl` and `oauthOrigin`. Together with `app.url` these retire the `VITE_` mirrors of the URL keys: the prefix only ever answered "how does this value reach the browser", so the value is now one declared field and delivery goes through `window.__AGENT_NATIVE_CONFIG__` alongside the existing Sentry, PostHog, and realtime scripts.

  Two self-dispatch bugs are fixed along the way. `integrations/webhook-handler.ts` and `integrations/a2a-continuation-processor.ts` each carried their own copy of "resolve my own base URL"; both omitted `DEPLOY_PRIME_URL`, so a Netlify deploy preview dispatched background work to production, and the continuation copy silently fell back to `http://localhost:${PORT}` in production, where the request never arrives and the work is dropped with no error. Both now delegate to `resolveSelfDispatchBaseUrl`.

  A new guard keeps the surface from growing back: `pnpm guard:no-legacy-config` fails when a line this branch adds reads `process.env` in `packages/core/src` outside the four resolvers, or calls a deprecated entry point. Opt out per line with `// config-ok: <reason>`.

  Declared configuration now generates its own documentation: `pnpm sync:config-docs` writes the field table into `docs/environment-variables.md`, and `pnpm guard:config-docs` fails when it is stale.

  Malformed values in migrated keys now fail at startup naming the key, instead of silently reading as `false` or falling back to a default. This affects `AGENT_ENGINE_PREFER_BYO_KEY`, `A2A_ALLOW_UNSIGNED_INTERNAL`, `AGENT_NATIVE_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_WEBHOOKS`, and the three agent run timeout/retention keys.

- febb983: Keep packaged Desktop SSO on canonical client origins, read partitioned identity cookies without URL-filtered Chromium lookups, and prevent a child app session from replacing the verified Dispatch authority.
- febb983: Retry workspace embed-session minting with the shared A2A secret when a target rejects org-secret authentication, with redacted mint diagnostics. Keep SSO fanout limited to canonical and explicitly registered own-origin apps; path-mounted workspace apps remain same-origin with Dispatch and keep their existing ambient session behavior, so this narrows fanout targets but is not origin isolation.
- febb983: Add redacted target-side diagnostics for workspace embed-session ticket consumption so missing, expired, replayed, mismatched, and successful exchanges can be distinguished in production logs.

## 0.157.18

### Patch Changes

Keep the registry action scoped to its verified A2A caller and refresh the desktop canary identity state before automatic sign-in.
- 907dfa3: Preserve organization Google-only policies during shared sign-in by marking only Dispatch identities with a verified Google account link, while keeping existing local accounts and sessions additive.
- 907dfa3: Return Google sign-in callbacks to native mobile clients using signed flow intent, even when the callback browser user-agent is not mobile, and hide the Agent-Native SSO control in embedded auth views.

### Patch Changes

- 5e19db2: Treat Netlify function runtimes as serverless when configuring database pools so abandoned transactions are reaped.

## 0.157.10

### Patch Changes

- 81fb79e: Keep the user's own messages in agent chat history when a tool-heavy turn is large. The request history was priced against one 64,000-char budget spent newest-first, so a single read-heavy assistant turn could evict every earlier thing the user asked for — in one measured production thread the model saw none of the user's previous nine asks and re-derived the same answer each turn. Tool payloads and user messages now draw on separate budgets, and an oversized recent turn no longer drops the cheaper messages behind it.
- 81fb79e: Allow the Clips ffmpeg runtime in Netlify function size checks while preserving frame extraction and video seekability.
- 81fb79e: Allow desktop hosts to provide a chat-first default app order while preserving user-pinned and manually reordered layouts.
- 81fb79e: Stop `get-extension` from re-fetching source the agent already holds. Identical `contentQuery` excerpts are now deduplicated per run the same way whole-body reads already were — one production turn spent 48 of its 110 extension reads re-sending spans it had just been given. The large-body hint also now says when a single `forceContent` read costs less context than repeated excerpts.
- 81fb79e: Hide app-owned chat sidebars when Electron or Dispatch provides the host chat.
- 81fb79e: Add a boolean-first hosted tools-only harness configuration for production apps, with Claude Code, Codex, Pi, and OpenCode runtime choices and no repository or code-editing access.
- 81fb79e: Keep Dispatch's collapsed chat-first sidebar actions visible and icon-only, matching the Electron rail.
- 81fb79e: Keep selected chat-first apps visible and open granted external apps from Dispatch.
- 81fb79e: Attribute client analytics, action calls, and agent runs with a canonical `client_platform` value for web, Electron, and mobile surfaces.
- 81fb79e: Name the case where an Observational Memory cursor cannot apply to the window it is given. The cursor is a position in whichever message array observed it, and the live agent loop's array counts each tool result separately while the store-derived one folds those into their tool-call parts — so a cursor from the longer basis leaves the thread permanently unable to observe anything, reported identically to "nothing new". It now says so instead.
- 81fb79e: Keep post-turn Observational Memory compaction alive on serverless hosts. The pass is issued after the turn's `done` event and has to finish a streaming model call before it writes, so on a host that freezes the isolate once the response settles the unregistered promise was simply killed and the thread never accrued the memory that would have spared the next turn. It now registers with the request's `waitUntil` when the platform provides one; long-lived hosts keep the existing fire-and-forget behavior.
- 81fb79e: Add Portal handoffs for resumable code-agent runs: snapshot local changes to a remote branch, prepare an isolated worktree on a paired computer, and load that computer's local environment without transferring secrets.
- 81fb79e: Read a line's `a:headEnd`/`a:tailEnd` decorations when importing a PPTX. A connector that terminates in a round dot at both ends — 11 of the 18 connectors on one real SlidesMania deck — imported as a bare rule, because the parser stopped at the stroke's colour and width. Ends of every type are now recorded on the element, including the ones a renderer cannot draw, so a skipped end stays distinguishable from a line the source drew bare.
- 81fb79e: Keep a PPTX picture's own frame geometry when importing, so a portrait cropped to an `ellipse` or freeform frame renders inside that shape instead of as the hard square its bounding box happens to be.
- 81fb79e: Preserve embedded chat transcript restoration when React StrictMode replays effects.
- 81fb79e: Create framework chat, agent-run, harness-session, and usage-alert tables in release migrations so production request functions do not fail on missing schema. Upgrade Better Auth to the newest mature 1.6.x release for the Drizzle adapter stack-overflow fix.
- 81fb79e: Recover conversation history on the server when a foreground turn arrives without any. The client trims history against a size budget, so a single tool-heavy turn could reduce it to nothing — and downstream that is indistinguishable from the first message of a new thread. An existing thread now falls back to a bounded, text-only window of what was said, so the agent stops re-deriving answers it already gave. A new contract test covers the client-trim → wire → engine-messages seam, where unit tests on both halves passed while the conversation went missing between them.
- 81fb79e: Make shared-auth rollout failures fail closed while allowing an explicitly allowlisted operator to manage feature flags across deployments without a local organization. Clear stale Dispatch fallback errors after a successful direct load, and keep hosted chat restore controls local-only.
- 81fb79e: Keep app chat context chips current and prevent hover chrome from flashing during app switches.
- 81fb79e: Allow chat-first surface tabs to expose the shared new-tab affordance used by desktop terminal tabs.

### Patch Changes

## 0.157.5

### Patch Changes

- 19581b5: Publish the Actions docs section (Overview, Defining Actions, Access & Authorization, Run Context, Other Surfaces, Advanced & Legacy) in place of the old monolithic actions page, and translate it into all ten supported locales.

## 0.157.4

### Patch Changes

- 9e21e1b: Collapse embedded app navigation while the per-app chat rail is open.
- 9e21e1b: Support app-scoped chat sidebars with a shared persisted open state and iframe-safe resizing.
- 9e21e1b: Hide the create-app control when the chat-first sidebar is collapsed.
- 9e21e1b: Keep ambient composer context chips isolated to the active app chat surface.
  Surface embedded app session state to trusted hosts so signed-out app chats can
  point users to the sign-in control in the app pane.
- 9e21e1b: Redirect tokenized legacy magic-link URLs to Better Auth's verification endpoint.
- 9e21e1b: Make account name editing compact and disable Save changes until the name differs from the saved value.
- 9e21e1b: Recover chat surfaces with an inaccessible saved thread by opening a fresh thread before the first message is sent.
- 9e21e1b: Remove the run-local option from shared signup and sign-in pages.
- 9e21e1b: Chat no longer flashes and yanks the scroll while an answer streams. Two causes,
  both in how streamed markdown was rendered:
  - The finished message was rendered as one whole-document ReactMarkdown while
    the streaming message was rendered as memoized per-block pieces. The instant
    streaming stopped, the element tree changed shape, so React unmounted the
    message and rebuilt it: code blocks re-highlighted, images refetched, and the
    height collapsed for a frame — the "jumps especially at the end" report. The
    block split now drives both phases, so nothing is rebuilt when a turn ends.
  - The in-progress tail rendered through a different component than completed
    blocks. A trailing newline promotes the tail to a completed block and the next
    character pulls it back, so on every line break that paragraph's DOM was
    destroyed and recreated — the "div rapidly being inserted and removed as text
    streams" report. The tail now renders through the same component, so the
    promotion reuses the DOM.

  The message list was keyed on a digest of every message's part structure, so
  the whole transcript unmounted and remounted each time a tool call started or a
  placeholder tool id was rewritten to its server id — a flash and a lost scroll
  position in the middle of an answer. That key guarded assistant-ui's stale
  tap-resource render errors, which the error boundary around the list already
  catches, clears and retries. `assistant-ui-part-churn.spec.tsx` drives part
  append, mutation, id rename and splice through both the repository-import and
  the streaming-adapter paths and records that no such error occurs, so the key is
  gone and the boundary remains.

  The scroll-to-bottom button was a flex sibling of the scroll viewport, so it
  took 28px from the viewport when it appeared and gave it back when it hid —
  and whether it appears is derived from scroll position, so it could scroll the
  content enough to hide itself, which showed it again. That loop is the scroll
  oscillating while text streams. It is now overlaid rather than in flow.

  A code block that lost its highlighted HTML (a re-highlight after its content
  changed) was hidden until Shiki resolved, blanking code the user was reading.
  Space is still reserved invisibly on first paint, but a block that has already
  painted never hides again.

  Using one split for both phases required the split to be faithful to a
  whole-document parse, which it was not: lists continue across blank lines and
  link-reference/footnote definitions resolve document-wide, so splitting on a
  blank line rendered a spaced list as several one-item lists and a referenced
  link as literal `[text]`. That was visible during streaming and was silently
  corrected only when the stream ended. `splitMarkdownBlocks` now keeps lists
  whole across blank lines and declines to split a document containing reference
  definitions, keeps indented code blocks whole across blank lines, and detects
  those definitions during the fence-aware scan rather than over the raw text —
  a TypeScript index signature inside a fence reads exactly like `[id]: url`, and
  matching it disabled splitting for the whole message. `markdown-block-split.spec.ts`
  asserts split/whole render parity construct by construct.

## 0.155.0

### Minor Changes

- 89f194f: Support durable, scoped GitHub sources and replayable sync for Builder design-system imports.

### Patch Changes

- 89f194f: Action routes now fall back to the caller's stored active organization when a
  cookie session resolves no org, matching what the adapter/A2A path already did.
  An empty org silently narrowed every scoped read to rows with a null `org_id`,
  so a user could stop seeing their own org-scoped dashboards and resources. An
  explicit Personal selection still resolves to no org, and a transient database
  failure propagates instead of reading as "this user has no org".
- 89f194f: Add `motion` to `BrandKitTokenType` so durations, easings, and transitions have
  a real category. Extractors drop tokens they cannot classify, so the missing
  bucket meant no imported design system ever carried its motion.
- 89f194f: Open agent chat image attachments in a full-size lightbox when their thumbnails are clicked.
- 89f194f: Keep the chat-first New chat action icon-only when the desktop rail is collapsed.
- 89f194f: Simplify share controls with compact copy-link rows and always-visible access details.
- 89f194f: Ensure durable resource instructions remain in lean agent prompts and fail loudly when AGENTS.md cannot be read.
- 89f194f: Hide `x-cloak` content in the extension iframe shell until Alpine boots.
  Extension content is a body snippet, so it cannot define the rule itself: an
  `x-cloak` overlay painted over the whole extension until the deferred Alpine
  CDN script resolved, and permanently when it failed to.
- 89f194f: Keep feedback and other sibling overlays open when launched from the Agent panel overflow menu.
- 89f194f: Repair and validate native database bindings against the Node runtime used by development, builds, and production starts.
- 89f194f: Convert bare Slack user IDs in outbound agent responses into native mentions.
- 89f194f: Add folder-backed agent packs with safe Claude/Cowork-style import, agent-owned
  references and skills, and a shared Factory Agents surface for managing simple
  agents alongside mounted agentic apps.
- 89f194f: Grayscale non-selected workspace app icons so the active app is easier to identify in the chat-first rail.
- 89f194f: Add an optional `submitContext` to the guided-questions payload, appended to the
  context of whichever message the card sends. A question card's answer opens a
  continuation turn that inherits nothing from the turn that posed it, so context
  the follow-up work depends on had no way to survive the hop.
- 89f194f: Detect active organization-scoped feature-flag rollouts for anonymous Desktop discovery while keeping authenticated authorization scoped to the user's email and organization.
- 89f194f: Preserve signed Builder callback state when mounted route events normalize away the raw query string.
- 89f194f: Provision cross-app SSO state and authorization-code tables during release migrations so production serverless requests never perform schema DDL.
- 89f194f: Keep approval continuations out of visible chat history and keep approval controls usable at narrow widths.
- 89f194f: Continue chat turns when a background tool completes before the assistant sends its final response.
- 89f194f: Add a safe inline Markdown renderer for compact user-authored text surfaces.
- 89f194f: Repair existing workspace app skill copies during scaffold updates by linking them to the shared workspace skill surface.
- 89f194f: Chat no longer renders the same assistant turn twice — the long-standing report
  of a final message streaming in two places at once and tool outputs appearing
  more than once. Four independent causes, all of which let one run be folded into
  UI state more than once:
  - SSE resume cursors were kept in a single browser-wide slot, and
    `updateActiveRunSeq` took no run identity, so it wrote the caller's sequence
    into whichever run happened to occupy the slot. With chats streaming in
    parallel (agent teams, multiple tabs) runs evicted each other, and
    `resolveReconnectAfterSeq` then returned 0 — replaying an entire run on top of
    history that already contained it. Cursors are now stored per `{threadId,
runId}`, identity is required to advance one, and a cursor outlives its run
    losing focus so a later reconnect resumes instead of replaying.
  - The adapter's stream and the reconnect reader could both fold one run at once.
    Ownership was a React ref re-checked by a 1s poll that is skipped while the tab
    is hidden, and the refs were per-component-instance while several chat
    instances mount against one run. Ownership now lives in a module-scoped
    registry claimed and checked synchronously, and the adapter preempts the
    reconnect fallback when it takes over.
  - The reconnect overlay was deliberately kept mounted beside the live message
    list for up to 2500ms after handoff, leaving two independent folds of the same
    turn on screen with only content-similarity heuristics hiding the second. The
    overlay now renders only while no runtime owns the turn.
  - The server fold pushed a tool card for every `tool_start`, including the
    replays that journal and zombie-ledger recovery emit for calls that already
    ran. The live client coalesced those onto the original card, so a duplicate
    tool output appeared only after a reload. A replayed `tool_start` now folds
    onto its existing card.

## 0.154.0

### Minor Changes

- 2db503b: Support durable, scoped GitHub sources and replayable sync for Builder design-system imports.

### Patch Changes

- 2db503b: Add `motion` to `BrandKitTokenType` so durations, easings, and transitions have
  a real category. Extractors drop tokens they cannot classify, so the missing
  bucket meant no imported design system ever carried its motion.
- 2db503b: Open agent chat image attachments in a full-size lightbox when their thumbnails are clicked.
- 2db503b: Simplify share controls with compact copy-link rows and always-visible access details.
- 2db503b: Ensure durable resource instructions remain in lean agent prompts and fail loudly when AGENTS.md cannot be read.
- 2db503b: Hide `x-cloak` content in the extension iframe shell until Alpine boots.
  Extension content is a body snippet, so it cannot define the rule itself: an
  `x-cloak` overlay painted over the whole extension until the deferred Alpine
  CDN script resolved, and permanently when it failed to.
- 2db503b: Repair and validate native database bindings against the Node runtime used by development, builds, and production starts.
- 2db503b: Add an optional `submitContext` to the guided-questions payload, appended to the
  context of whichever message the card sends. A question card's answer opens a
  continuation turn that inherits nothing from the turn that posed it, so context
  the follow-up work depends on had no way to survive the hop.

### Patch Changes

- 8008dfe: Centralize product docs links behind `docsUrl()` and retarget Settings, Team, onboarding, and template help links at live agent-native.com docs pages.

## 0.153.9

### Patch Changes

- f5dc763: Export `readClientAppStateMany` (and its `ClientAppStateBatch` return type) from `@agent-native/core/client/hooks`, alongside its sibling application-state helpers, so the documented batched-read import actually resolves.
- f5dc763: Split the Client docs page into focused Overview, Data & Sync, Agent Chat, Routing, Advanced, Sync Internals, and Entry Points pages, translate them into all ten supported locales, and fix several inaccurate examples and dead links found in review.

## 0.153.8

### Patch Changes

- a97789e: Bound one stale-run reap pass and stop swallowing per-row reap failures. `reapAllStaleRuns` now returns `{ reaped, failed, truncated }` instead of a bare count, so a pass where every row threw is no longer indistinguishable from "nothing was stale", and a pass that hit the batch cap is no longer reported as a clean sweep.

## 0.153.7

### Patch Changes

- 518ebf0: Align stale-run recovery persistence tests with the normalized terminal reason written by the reaper.

## 0.153.6

### Patch Changes

- 9f0ae16: Stop the chat continuation guards from ending turns that were still working: an explicit `recoverable: false` on an error event now outranks the transient message sniff (a repeat-guard stop naming a `*connection*` tool auto-continued the loop it was meant to break), `loop_limit` work boundaries are bounded by their own ceiling instead of the transient-failure one, and the stall signal is read from each round's delta so an unresolved "Preparing" card cannot make later rounds look stuck. History trimming also prices object tool results by what the request actually sends instead of `[object Object]`.
- 9f0ae16: Fix stale agent runs never being reaped in production. The periodic stale reaper
  lived on an in-process timer that `shouldDisableInProcessSweeps()` turns off for
  every production serverless function, and nothing durable replaced it, so a run
  whose producer died stayed "running" until an unrelated request path happened to
  notice. Stale reaping now rides the signed, platform-scheduled recurring-job
  sweep — one site-wide reap per tick instead of one per warm container.

  Also corrects what the reapers record: `completed_at` is now the run's last
  liveness basis rather than the time a reaper noticed, so a reaped run reports its
  real duration instead of detection latency; and `terminal_reason` is the
  normalized `error:stale_run` that the event reconciler already writes for the
  same outcome, so one failure no longer splits across two permanent
  `agent_run_outcome_daily` buckets. Heartbeat writes are bounded to one attempt
  inside a third of the stale window, so a live run can no longer be reaped while
  its own heartbeat is still in flight holding a pooler connection.

- 9f0ae16: Use a clear loading message for the route transition indicator instead of exposing the destination URL.
- 9f0ae16: Keep agent runs alive when the SQL abort state is briefly unreadable. A few consecutive failed abort-state reads (roughly 9s of database unreadability) used to self-abort the run with `aborted_abort_check_unavailable`, killing in-flight work the user was waiting on. The check now fails open and reports the outage to Sentry instead; the run stays bounded by the soft timeout, no-progress backstop, and iteration limits.
- 9f0ae16: Stop the new repeat-loop guards from killing turns that would have succeeded: network "connect … before/first" failures and retention-window "only available in …" errors no longer read as permanent preconditions, per-item errors that differ only by id (`Record 41 not found`) are counted separately again, the permanent-precondition stop keeps the raw tool error in `details` like every other terminal stop, an explicit `recoverable: false` outranks the message sniff, a single ledger-read blip is retried before the turn stops, and the persisted-thread rebuild scopes retry clears exactly like the live client so narration no longer vanishes on reload.

## 0.153.5

### Patch Changes

- 47ba57a: Add an optional `grounding` declaration to `defineAction` so an action can state that a successful call returns real evidence from a data source, instead of apps maintaining separate name lists that drift.
- 47ba57a: Stop runaway chat turns: one "did this continuation advance?" budget now covers every reason code including `loop_limit`, failed prior-turn tool calls replay as failures instead of successes, and a retry `clear` no longer deletes narration from earlier steps of the turn.
- 47ba57a: Gate connected-agent mutations to workspace owners and admins instead of issuing failed shared-resource writes for organization members.
- 2498cff: Use normalized tool inputs when enforcing per-turn repeat-call guards.
- 47ba57a: Make agent repetition guards hold across continuation chunks, record guard stops as failed runs, and stop retrying a precondition the turn cannot satisfy.

## 0.153.4

### Patch Changes

- 73e47fe: Fix `findMcpIntegrationForText` suggesting the Box MCP integration on unrelated
  prose (e.g. "text box", "bounding box"). Added an optional `promptAliases`
  field on `DefaultMcpIntegration` so ambiguous display names can require a
  qualified phrase before matching; the Box integration now only matches
  "Box.com", "Box files", "Box folder", or "Box drive".
- 405e17e: Gate connected-agent mutations to workspace owners and admins instead of issuing failed shared-resource writes for organization members.

- b3b4580: Resolve saved provider credentials when an explicit engine selection reaches chat without a carried key.
- b3b4580: Use app-owned chat navigation for the sidebar's "Open full view" action instead of routing chat users to agent settings.
- b3b4580: Show route transitions as a top progress bar instead of a corner card printing the destination URL, and deprecate `useNearBottomAutoscroll` in favor of the scroll handling `AgentConversation` already does.
- b3b4580: Separate read-only Viewer access from the new Commenter role in shared resources.
- b3b4580: Smooth streamed chat text and tool activity with shadcn's anchored message scroller, incremental rich Markdown rendering, and consistent reveal pacing. Prevent a delegated sub-agent call from splitting one turn's tools into two sections, including during reconnect.

- a426c4f: Retry transient reads from encrypted public-upload private blob handles so newly uploaded references are available before import begins.
- a426c4f: Pin the Tiptap dependency family in fresh scaffolds so generated builds use the tested versions together.

## 0.149.4

### Patch Changes

- 86a9c74: Declare `includedFiles: ["**"]` on the emitted `agent-native-recurring-jobs` Netlify scheduled function so publishing no longer fails with "outside the supported packaging slice"; its entry imports `node:crypto`, and the deploy packager only accepts an omitted `includedFiles` for import-free scheduled functions.

## 0.149.3

### Patch Changes

- 44ac2c4: Support hosted database initialization in Better Auth.
- 44ac2c4: Prevent chat turns from getting stuck after active-run conflicts or delayed progress persistence, and keep completion controls synchronized with terminal state.

## 0.149.2

### Patch Changes

- dab8787: Fix the chat sidebar repainting glitches that made app content flash, shift, and
  render as flat empty rectangles while the agent was generating.

  Three properties on the always-mounted sidebar promoted or re-promoted a
  compositing layer on every app that renders `AgentSidebar`:
  - `will-change: transform` sat permanently on the sidebar panel (desktop, mobile
    and drawer variants). It wraps the whole chat transcript and is never
    unmounted, so the hint was never retired. The 260ms transform transition is
    promoted by the browser on its own for exactly as long as it runs.
  - `view-transition-name` was stamped on the panel unconditionally, including in
    apps that never start a chat view transition. A permanent name makes the panel
    a stacking context and the containing block for every fixed and absolutely
    positioned descendant, and enlists it as a captured group in unrelated route
    view transitions. It is now applied only while the wide-drawer morph runs.
  - The chat scroller's top-fade `mask-image` was added and removed with the
    `hasContentAbove` class, which flips as replies stream into an auto-scrolled
    transcript. The mask is now always declared and only its length changes.

  The same two defects existed independently on the workspace shell sidebar in
  `@agent-native/frame`, which hosts the agent panel, so the promotions nested.
  Fixed there too.

  Regression tests cover all three invariants, and a new repo-wide
  `pnpm guard:persistent-compositing` fails on any new compositing promotion on a
  long-lived surface. Genuinely transient elements (a popover that unmounts on
  close, a drag preview) opt out with a `compositing-ok: <reason>` comment.

- dab8787: Keep Claude Code runs in auto-edit mode edit-capable instead of silently downgrading them to read-only.
- dab8787: Keep native desktop sign-in aligned with the shared magic-link and Google login flow.
- dab8787: Keep Builder Visual Editor links out of chat-first browser iframes so branch links open without CSP framing errors.

- 061896a: Document prerendering in the scaffolded app's `react-router.config.ts`: a commented, correct example with the three conditions a path must meet (public, build-time constant, never redirecting), left off by default because every route the scaffold ships is signed-in and a prerendered file is served without auth middleware running.

### Patch Changes

## 0.146.6

### Patch Changes

- a882a53: Make a slow cold-start response diagnosable from one look. HTTP telemetry now
  reports the pre-handler boot phases (`boot_to_module_ms`, `module_to_request_ms`)
  that no in-handler measurement can see, logs one structured line to stdout for
  every cold or slow (>=1s) request, and stops putting live-looking per-phase
  `server-timing` entries on shared-cacheable responses — a CDN replays those
  bytes, so a cacheable response now carries a single `origin` entry stamped with
  the wall-clock time of the render that produced it.
- a882a53: Stop MCP hydration from running on every serverless cold start. Eager
  initialization now only happens on long-lived runtimes; serverless functions
  initialize on first use from the agent-chat handler, the MCP management routes,
  and the recurring-jobs sweep. The 60-second MCP config refresh timer is gated by
  `shouldDisableInProcessSweeps()` like the other in-process sweeps, and an
  unreadable settings table now rejects with `McpConfigUnreadableError` instead of
  being coerced into "no MCP servers configured".
- a882a53: Stop inlining the translation catalog into the render-blocking locale init
  script. `getLocaleInitScript()` now emits only `locale`, `preference`, and
  `dir`; the catalog already reaches `AgentNativeI18nProvider` through loader data
  as `initialMessages`. The `messages` option is removed — passing it is now a
  type error rather than a silently duplicated payload.
- a882a53: Provision recurring scheduler health during release migrations so serverless background sweeps can execute scheduled automations.
- a882a53: Stop shipping the serverless browser runtime into apps that cannot use it. The
  Chromium/Playwright copy now runs only when the app itself depends on the
  browser runtime, instead of resolving a sibling workspace package's Chromium
  through the pnpm store. Serverless function dirs also drop prebuilds that cannot
  execute on Linux x64/arm64 and any local `data/` database before the
  extra Netlify functions are cloned, and the Netlify deploy guard now reports
  per-function sizes and fails when one exceeds its budget.

## 0.146.4

### Patch Changes

- e959709: Keep app-owned scheduled automations on the scheduler for the app that created them.
- e959709: Keep approval controls visible when a paused chat tool call is rebuilt from its stored events.
- e959709: Deploying a new app now migrates at release time with no configuration.

  `agent-native create` generates a `CONTEXT=production` migration step in the
  app's Netlify build command, and the scaffold ships `scripts/migrate-production.ts`.
  Create an app, connect Netlify, and schema is owned by the deploy — there is no
  flag to set and no step to remember.

  The serverless request-path migration skip is now the default rather than
  opt-in. An earlier iteration gated it behind `AGENT_NATIVE_RELEASE_MIGRATIONS`,
  which was the wrong shape: a flag you must remember is a flag half the fleet
  will not have, and it left "migrate on every cold start" as the default for
  every app that did not set it. All templates now ship the release step instead.

  Also fixes a real regression this introduced: the Netlify rewrite detected the
  existing build command with `command = "([^"]*)"`, which stops at the first
  escaped quote. Every generated command now contains `\"` from the CONTEXT test,
  so the `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` override silently vanished for the four
  templates that use it, and a created app would have built against the pooled URL.

- e959709: Scope workspace automations to their owning app by default, keep Dispatch's all-apps view explicit, and expose failed run threads for troubleshooting.

## 0.146.3

### Patch Changes

- 62f694b: Add four new docs MDX components — `Notice`, `Banner`, `Accordion`, `Badge` — for content that doesn't belong in a `Cards` grid: a bold alert card, a page/section-top announcement strip, collapsed-by-default FAQ items, and a small status chip. Also fixes the `Steps`/`Cards`/`Comparison`/`Accordion` markdown parser to be fence-aware (a `###` inside a code sample no longer splits into a new item) and to round-trip items with a genuinely empty body, and teaches the docs' crawlable markdown mirror to render all seven docs-only block types as readable text instead of a raw JSON fence.

## 0.146.1

### Patch Changes

- 6071f7d: Provision and reuse the connected Builder workspace project automatically for hosted Turn Into App requests.
- 6071f7d: Compact agent sidebar shortcut hints and keep the sidebar's wider drawer as its only expand action.
- 6071f7d: Make the serverless request-path migration skip opt-in via
  `AGENT_NATIVE_RELEASE_MIGRATIONS`.

  `runMigrations` skips schema work in a production serverless request runtime,
  which is correct only for an app that migrates somewhere else. Exactly one of
  seventeen templates has a release migration entrypoint. For the other sixteen,
  an unconditional skip would not defer the work — it would delete it: a newly
  added migration silently never applies, and a fresh deploy comes up with
  missing tables. Nothing fails at the moment of the skip, so the first symptom
  is a missing-table error in production, far from the cause.

  An app now declares that it owns migrations at release time by setting
  `AGENT_NATIVE_RELEASE_MIGRATIONS=1`. Analytics sets it in `netlify.toml`
  alongside its `migrate:production` build step; every other app keeps its
  existing behavior until it has one.

  Note that the Netlify _build_ environment also sets `NETLIFY=true`, so the
  release step itself looks like a serverless request to this guard — it works
  only because the entrypoint claims duty through `withMigrationRuntime()`. A
  migration entrypoint that forgets that wrapper silently no-ops at build time.

## 0.146.0

### Minor Changes

- c440e50: Add opt-in audience-specific instruction paths and make `agent-native.config.ts` the canonical typed config filename.

### Patch Changes

- c440e50: Stop a refused database connection from immediately producing another attempt.

  Neon rejects a connection _attempt_, not a connection: "Failed to acquire
  permit to connect to the database. Too many database connection attempts are
  currently ongoing." A failed acquire leaves the pool with zero idle clients, so
  the next `execute()` calls `connect()` again — and `retryOnConnectionError`
  backs off only 100ms. The process answered each refusal by manufacturing the
  next attempt, which is what kept the refusal true; production stayed wedged
  until the compute was restarted by hand.

  Every Neon pool now passes through `guardNeonPool` (renamed from
  `attachNeonPoolErrorLogger`), which holds a short jittered per-endpoint
  cooldown after a failed attempt. Checking out an already-idle client is not an
  attempt and still succeeds, so a cooldown degrades throughput instead of taking
  a warm instance offline. `DbConnectCooldownError` is deliberately not
  classified as a connection error, so the retry loop exits instead of re-entering
  the storm, and it reads as transient so shed load surfaces as 503 rather than 500. Tune with `DB_CONNECT_COOLDOWN_MS`.

  The added `url` argument makes any pool that skips the gate a compile error
  rather than a silent bypass.

- c440e50: Offer local source-code handoffs to external coding agents instead of the Builder waitlist.

## 0.145.8

### Patch Changes

- c497c85: Stop running schema migrations on the serverless request path, and name every
  database connection.

  `runMigrations` now returns early in a production serverless request runtime.
  The guard lives in the shared runner rather than at each call site: the
  analytics template guarded its own runner, but `org`, `context-xray`, and
  `observational-memory` kept calling `runMigrations` unguarded, so the
  cold-start probe storm survived the fix meant to end it. Measured in
  production: the schema snapshot alone costs 5.5-8.6s on a 180-table database,
  with 4-6 copies running concurrently under load — and when it times out,
  `ddl-guard` falls back to a per-object probe across ~390 call sites, so
  starvation multiplies its own query count.

  A scheduled or background runtime claims migration duty through
  `withMigrationRuntime()`, and `runInServerlessRequest: true` remains the
  explicit opt-in for a caller that cannot defer. The database client also
  rejects unguarded schema DDL from production functions, so a new `ensureTable`
  path fails loudly instead of quietly reintroducing the incident.

  Better Auth table creation now lives in the framework's release migration
  entrypoint, and Analytics' production deploy runs its framework and template
  migrations once during the release build. No production request needs an
  environment variable to skip schema work.

  Postgres pools now set `application_name`. Every backend previously reported
  `pgbouncer`, which made a 58 MB `SELECT id, config FROM dashboards` running
  20-wide against production impossible to attribute — it appears nowhere in the
  repo or any built bundle, and `pg_stat_statements` is not installed.

- c497c85: Use layout-matching skeleton placeholders for shared settings loading states.

## 0.145.7

### Patch Changes

- 25e1bcf: Reset the poll backoff when sync health-gates from the hosted gateway to local. The failure count earned against an unreachable gateway was carried into local mode, delaying the first local poll by up to 8 minutes even though the app's own origin was reachable.

## 0.145.6

### Patch Changes

- 1d5bab1: Keep the chat and prompt composer visible while assistant-ui recovers from a transient render error.
- 1d5bab1: Stop cold-started processes from replaying the entire durable action-marker
  history. `seedVersionFromDb` rewound the marker watermark to `0` so a marker
  written just before boot still reached the first poll, but the replay filter is
  `updated_at > watermark` and the `__action_change__` table is one never-pruned
  row per identity that has ever run a mutating action — so every boot re-emitted
  all of it. On one production app that was 2,188 rows replayed ~32 times a
  minute: 1,169 sync events/sec against ~1.7/sec of real traffic, and a 47 GB
  `sync_events` table. The rewind is now bounded to a 60-second replay window,
  which preserves its purpose, and the marker read is bounded by the same
  watermark instead of selecting the whole table.

  Also enables `deterministicEventIds` for the default sync state so concurrent
  processes detecting the same external write collapse via `ON CONFLICT (id) DO
NOTHING`, and keys the action-marker dedupe on each row's own `updated_at`
  rather than the table-wide maximum. That mechanism defaulted off and was never
  set anywhere, so every `dedupeKey` in the poll path had been inert.

  `manage-agent-engine` now classifies `test` and `get-app-default` as reads
  alongside `list`, so those calls no longer announce a change.

- 1d5bab1: Fix MCP integration logos so every catalog entry uses a real mark and dark marks stay legible.
- 1d5bab1: Accept OAuth client metadata documents that advertise additional extension grant types, including Claude's JWT bearer grant, while preserving the server's authorization-code flow.
- 1d5bab1: Stop the chat client from durably aborting background runs that are still
  working.

  The kill verdict was rendered against a `/runs/active` snapshot fetched
  _before_ the SSE attach that had just blocked for its whole duration, so any
  progress that landed during the attach was invisible to the decision. Fleet
  data: 23 of 24 client-watchdog kills hit runs that had made server-authoritative
  progress within the previous 90 seconds. The client now takes a second reading
  after the attach, and only on the path that would otherwise condemn the run —
  the healthy path pays nothing.

  A failed or unparseable `/runs/active` poll no longer counts as "no active run".
  Unreadable and absent were the same value, and the absent branch reached the
  durable abort without consulting progress at all, so one flaky tick could end a
  live turn.

  A model-stream retry the user waited through is now narrated instead of silently
  wiping the transcript. Three 90-second retries used to blank the screen at 92s,
  182s, and 272s with no explanation — the shape people report as "the chat froze".
  Fast provider blips stay silent.

- 1d5bab1: Add an opt-in database-pressure reading to `/_agent-native/health?pressure=1`.
  The route reports the three `pg_stat_activity` signals that preceded the
  2026-08-06 analytics outage — idle-in-transaction pileup, slow trivial queries,
  and one query stampeding — so a scheduled fleet audit can watch them without
  holding any production database credential of its own. A dialect or connection
  that cannot answer reports `measured: false` with a reason rather than a clean
  zero, and pressure never changes `ready` or the response status.
- 1d5bab1: Preserve incomplete provider-corpus coverage when a paginated search stops at a page cap.
- 1d5bab1: Preserve OAuth authentication for legacy MCP endpoint configurations.
- 1d5bab1: Keep the magic-link onboarding form as the default view when outbound email is ready, while preserving explicit password sign-in fallbacks.
- 1d5bab1: Keep inline help affordances visually subordinate to the text they explain.
- 1d5bab1: Paginate long organization member lists in settings.
- 1d5bab1: Add shared production configuration diagnostics, deploy guidance, and an
  in-app warning chip with a copyable AI remediation prompt. Agent-Native app
  configuration now supports deep-merged runtime requirements and typed
  `agent-native.ts` aliases alongside `agent-native.json`.
- 1d5bab1: Fix the `sync_events` retention prune, which planned as a sequential scan of
  the entire table. It now deletes by the already-indexed `version` column
  (monotonic epoch milliseconds) in bounded batches, oldest first, and reports a
  failure instead of swallowing it. On one production app the old statement was
  scanning a 47 GB table roughly 60 times concurrently, and a prune that never
  succeeded was indistinguishable from one with nothing to do.
- 1d5bab1: Polish streaming tool-call motion so new calls fade in, retained rows slide with
  the stack, and older calls visibly settle into the collapsed tool summary.
- 1d5bab1: Add a keyboard-accessible 75% chat drawer while keeping the app layout stable.

## 0.145.5

### Patch Changes

- da40677: Fix realtime voice tool calls failing with "Invalid or expired realtime voice capability" on serverless deploys. The capability minted by `/_agent-native/realtime-voice/session` lived in a per-process `Map`, so under `NITRO_PRESET=netlify` a tool call that landed on a different instance than the SDP request was rejected — the agent would report that it could not read the current selection and ask the user to reopen the editor. The capability is now an HMAC-signed token carrying the caller's identity, browser tab, and allowed tool names, so any instance can verify it.

  Two behavior changes follow from that. The grant no longer slides on use — it cannot be extended server-side — so its TTL is now an absolute 75 minutes, covering the provider's maximum session length. And when a `tool-search` widens the manifest, the tool response carries a re-issued capability that the client adopts; without it, calls to the newly discovered tools would 404.

  Fix dictation stopping instantly with no error anywhere. `SpeechRecognition` always fires `end` after `error`, and `useVoiceDictation`'s `end` handler returned the composer to idle — erasing the message `onerror` had just set. Every speech failure was therefore invisible in both the UI and the console. `end` no longer overwrites a reported error.

  Dictation also survives browsers that ship `SpeechRecognition` without a speech backend. Brave exposes `webkitSpeechRecognition` but removed the Google service behind it, so `auto` mode selected a recognizer that can only ever fail with `network`. In `auto` mode a recognizer that produced no text — because it failed, or because it ended before the microphone opened — now falls back to the MediaRecorder upload path. Permission and device errors are excluded, since retrying those through another provider fails identically. A mid-session drop that already captured speech keeps the transcript rather than failing over.

  The amplitude meter's own `getUserMedia` also moved to after recognition claims the microphone, since taking the device first can make Chrome abort the session.

## 0.145.4

### Patch Changes

- db62d66: Fix `frameworkTools` silently ignoring eight of its own switches.

  `sharing`, `review`, `history`, `featureFlags`, `localization`, `contextXray`, `userProfile`, and `audit` are removed by `filterFrameworkToolGroups`, which matched on `ActionEntry.frameworkGroup`. That tag is written in exactly one place — `mergeCoreSharingActions` — and the plugin calls it against `httpActions`, the registry documented as deliberately ungated so the UI keeps working. So the tag never reached the agent registry: any app loading core kits through `loadActionsFromStaticRegistry` or its own actions directory held untagged entries, and setting those eight groups to `false` did nothing. The other groups (`database`, `extensions`, `automation`, `docs`, `resources`, `web`, `workspaceApps`, `chat`, `email`) were unaffected — they are gated at construction, where the registry is built empty.

  Group membership now resolves by name first and tag second (`resolveFrameworkGroup`), so a switch works no matter how the action was registered. `CORE_ACTION_GROUPS` moves to `framework-tools.ts` (still re-exported from `action-discovery.ts`) so the filter can read it without an import cycle; the `frameworkGroup` stamp stays as a pre-resolved copy but nothing depends on it any more.

  The same tag dependency broke `resolveInitialToolNames`, which excludes framework kits from the DEFAULT first-request tool list — untagged apps were promoting ~45 framework schemas into every first request. Fixed by the same change.

  Guard tests cover both consumers using deliberately **untagged** fixtures built from `CORE_ACTION_GROUPS`, since the previous tests hand-stamped `frameworkGroup` and so passed against inputs no real app produced. They also assert an app action that merely resembles a kit name (`share-portfolio` under `sharing: false`) is left alone.

- db62d66: Accept Client ID Metadata documents that advertise grant types beyond `authorization_code`/`refresh_token`. The MCP OAuth client-metadata validator rejected the whole document when it listed any other grant — so Claude.ai, whose CIMD document also lists `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer`, could not connect at all. Only the length/shape of `grant_types` is validated now; the token endpoint already honors just `authorization_code` and `refresh_token` regardless of what the document declares.
- db62d66: Consolidate every MCP setting on `createAgentChatPlugin` under one `mcp: {}` option, and add `mcp.catalog: "app"`.

  `mcp` accepts `enabled`, `catalog`, `connectorCatalog`, `externalAgents`, `builtinCrossAppTools`, `title`, `description`, `websiteUrl`, and `icons`. The top-level `disableMcp`, `mcpServerInfo`, `connectorCatalog`, and `externalAgents` stay accepted for one minor and are deprecated; the nested value wins, and setting both forms to disagreeing values throws at plugin init rather than booting an app with an MCP surface nobody chose (same contract as `resolveFrameworkTools`). `disableMcp: true` and `mcp.enabled: false` are normalized as inverses, so a correctly migrated app is not read as a conflict.

  Two behavior fixes come with it:
  - `builtinCrossAppTools` had no route through the plugin at all — it was reachable only by calling `mountMCP` directly. That is why `frameworkTools: "minimal"` and `workspaceApps: false` could never remove the cross-app builtins (`list_apps`, `open_app`, `ask_app`, `ask_app_status`, `create_embed_session`, `create_workspace_app`, `list_templates`) from an app using the normal plugin entry point: the MCP layer merges them downstream of the `frameworkTools` filter. `mcp.builtinCrossAppTools: false` is now the switch.
  - A2A read the connector policy straight off the raw plugin options, so `mcp.connectorCatalog` would have narrowed the MCP surface while A2A kept serving the old one. `filterDirectA2AActions` / `buildAuthenticatedAgentA2ASkills` now take the resolved shape, so the two external surfaces cannot diverge.

  `mcp.catalog: "app"` serves external callers exactly the app's own tool registry, flat — the same actions the in-app agent holds, with no cross-app builtins, no `ask-agent`, no `tool-search`, and no compact/connector trimming. `externalAgents.denyActions` and the OAuth scope filter still apply, since both are explicit removals rather than catalog tiering, and the dev-open surface split is unchanged (an unauthenticated loopback probe still gets `actions`, not `productionActions`). Weigh the token cost before setting it: an app registering ~100 actions puts every schema in the caller's context on `tools/list`, which is what the compact default exists to avoid.

  Also folds the per-tier `tools/call` gate into one rule — the advertised set is the callable surface on every tier except the explicit `--full-catalog` opt-in — so adding a tier can no longer default to "everything callable" by omission.

  `tool-search` is fixed on both ends over MCP. It is dropped entirely from every flat catalog (`mcp.catalog: "app"` and the `--full-catalog` opt-in), where every tool is already listed beside it and it could only describe its own neighbours. On the trimmed catalogs, where it does earn its place, it is now scoped to the advertised set: previously it closed over the app's whole registry while `tools/call` accepted only the advertised subset, so it answered with names that came straight back as "Unknown tool". `attachToolSearch`, `searchToolRegistry`, `createToolSearchEntry`, `TOOL_SEARCH_ACTION_NAME`, `resolveFrameworkTools`, `filterFrameworkToolGroups`, and `frameworkGroupEnabled` are now exported from `@agent-native/core/server`, so a standalone `mountMCP` plugin can compose the same surface the agent-chat plugin does instead of hand-rolling a copy that drifts.

## 0.145.3

### Patch Changes

- c2b7f82: Bound how long a hosted realtime stream can outlive the session that authorized it. Subscribe tokens now carry an optional `absExp` ceiling that `verifyRealtimeSubscribeToken` enforces independently of `exp` (rejecting with `session_expired`), and the mint endpoint sets it to 15 minutes. The gateway re-signs a stream's token every few minutes without consulting the app, so previously one mint could be extended indefinitely and logout, session expiry, user deletion or org removal never reached an open stream. Rotation must copy `absExp` verbatim and refuse to rotate past it.

  `AppSyncStateOptions` also gains `accessAllowTtlMs` (default 30s). `invalidateCollabAccessCache` only reaches the in-process default instance, so a gateway holding per-app instances cannot be told a share was revoked and keeps serving its cached ALLOW until the TTL lapses; a shorter value bounds that window at the cost of more `can-see` round-trips.

## 0.145.2

### Patch Changes

- 66d6736: Stop handing an Anthropic credential to a non-Anthropic engine. When a user selected an OpenAI (or Gemini, Groq, Mistral, Cohere) engine but had no key for it, the deploy-level `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — or the plugin's `options.apiKey` — was passed straight through to that provider's endpoint. The provider rejected it with a 401, and the failure was then recorded against `OPENAI_API_KEY`, so the user saw "the model provider rejected the saved API key" for a key they had never saved.

  `resolveEngine` now accepts `apiKeyEnvVar` so a caller can declare which env var its key was issued for, and drops the key when the selected engine does not use that var. The previous protection compared key values against stored secrets, which only worked on automatic engine selection and could never match a host-supplied key; declaring provenance covers the explicit `engineOption` branches too.

  Every caller that resolved a key before choosing an engine now goes through one resolver, `resolveOwnerEngineApiKey`, which reads the key for the engine that will actually be selected instead of for whatever the saved `agent-engine` setting names. That closes the same leak in web chat with a plugin-level `engine`, `completeText`, the A2A and MCP processors, agent-teams sub-agents, and Brain's capture classifier. Chat title generation posts directly to Anthropic, so it now asks for the owner's Anthropic key specifically and falls back to a truncated title rather than sending another provider's key; the sub-agent Anthropic fallback engine likewise refuses to inherit a run key issued for a different provider.

  The chat `save-key` route reads the provider-to-env mapping from `PROVIDER_ENV_META` instead of a local copy that omitted OpenRouter, and the environment-variable docs list `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` alongside the other provider fallbacks plus `AGENT_ENGINE` / `AGENT_ENGINE_PREFER_BYO_KEY`.

## 0.145.1

### Patch Changes

- b242acf: Cut idle database round trips on serverless deployments.
  - The Netlify keep-warm scheduled function is now opt-out and its cadence configurable (`AGENT_NATIVE_DISABLE_KEEP_WARM`, `AGENT_NATIVE_KEEP_WARM_SCHEDULE`), and the expensive background-function warm can be dropped on its own (`AGENT_NATIVE_DISABLE_KEEP_WARM_BACKGROUND`). Previously a once-a-minute wake was hardcoded, so a scale-to-zero database (Neon, Aurora Serverless v2, paused-compute Supabase) never autosuspended and burned its compute quota with zero users online. Defaults are unchanged; an unparseable cron fails the build rather than silently reverting to the old cadence.
  - Thread ACL checks no longer load the conversation blob. `resolveThreadAccess` was loading the full `chat_threads` row — including `thread_data` — for the access decision, discarding it, and reading the same row again, so every agent-chat request downloaded the conversation twice. The share dialog and collab routes got the same projected-load fix.
  - The SQL-backed SSE relay now backs off from 500ms toward 2s after a run has been quiet for several polls, and probes `reapIfStale` on its own 5s cadence instead of the 500ms status cadence — a reap cannot match a row younger than 15s, so it was issuing ~30 rounds of round trips before it could do anything. Streaming cadence is unchanged.
  - The in-process backstop sweep timers can be turned off with `AGENT_NATIVE_DISABLE_INPROCESS_SWEEPS` where a durable scheduler already drives the same recovery. On serverless these timers run per warm container, so their query rate scaled with instance count rather than with load.
  - Domain auto-join no longer probes `organizations` on every authenticated request. It short-circuits free email providers (which can never match, since an org may not claim one as its `allowed_domain`) and caches a no-match per domain, invalidated when `allowed_domain` is written. Previously this ran once per request for every account not already in a domain-matched org, with no fixed point.
  - Session-token and org-membership resolution are cached across requests behind short TTLs plus write invalidation, instead of one round trip each per request. `getAllSettings` is memoized per request and now seeds the single-key settings cache.
  - Added `shared/ttl-cache.ts` as the single bounded-TTL cache primitive and moved the hand-rolled one in `triggers/condition-evaluator.ts` onto it. Failed reads are never cached anywhere, so an unreadable table can't be served as "absent".
  - On-demand `ensureTable()` schema probes are answered from one batched introspection pass per database (two queries) instead of one query per table, column, and index — up to ~390 serial round trips per cold start before this. The snapshot is keyed per database client, so the hosted multi-app gateway can never be answered with another app's schema, and an unreadable `information_schema` falls back to per-object probes rather than being read as "the schema is empty". `AGENT_NATIVE_SKIP_ENSURE_TABLES=1` skips the probe-and-DDL machinery entirely for deployments that run real migrations.
  - Default resources are seeded once per database instead of once per process, behind a durable marker. Previously every cold start re-issued ~10 `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` writes plus two migration scans for rows that had existed since day one. Note the behavior change: a default resource the user deletes is no longer silently recreated on the next cold start.
  - Expired agent-scratch cleanup no longer blocks resource reads. `resourceGet`/`resourceGetByPath`/`resourceList` each awaited a `DELETE` before their own `SELECT`, which doubled the round trips, took row locks inside a user-facing request, and could fail the read outright.
  - `useDbSync` now applies `actionInvalidatePredicate` to the framework-prefix invalidate too. An app's opt-out list was silently conditional: honoured for batches carrying an `action` event, ignored for batches carrying only `db`/`collab`/`settings`/`screen-refresh`.

## 0.145.0

### Minor Changes

- 48bc314: Add `frameworkTools` to `createAgentChatPlugin()` so an app can choose which of the framework's own agent tools it exposes — `database`, `extensions`, `sharing`, `review`, `history`, `featureFlags`, `localization`, `audit`, `contextXray`, `userProfile`, `automation`, `docs`, `resources`, `web`, `workspaceApps`, `chat`, and `email`, plus a `"minimal"` preset. Disabling a group removes it from the agent surfaces (chat, MCP, A2A, background runs) while leaving its HTTP action routes mounted for the UI, and drops the prompt blocks that named its tools.

  Framework tools are also no longer promoted into the first model request by default: the ~45 sharing/review/history/flag schemas that `autoDiscoverActions` merges in now stay behind `tool-search` unless an app names them in `initialToolNames`. Apps keep every capability and send a much smaller first request.

  Deprecates the top-level `databaseTools` and `extensionTools` options in favor of `frameworkTools.database` and `frameworkTools.extensions`. Both are still honored; setting a top-level flag and its `frameworkTools` equivalent to conflicting values now throws at plugin startup instead of booting with an unintended tool surface.

## 0.144.3

### Patch Changes

- bd0b0cd: Hold the poll slot until an attempt settles, and abort in-flight attempts on stop()

## 0.144.2

### Patch Changes

- e139a20: Share one browser session id across the agent run and the actions a page calls. Only the chat adapter sent `X-Agent-Native-Session-Id`, and only the agent-run path read it, so `RequestContext.browserSessionId` was always undefined inside an action — a UI action call and the agent's own call during the same visit could not be joined to one `$session_id`. The action client now sends the header and the action route reads it into request context.

  Let `track()` take an action's `ctx` as its third argument — `track("project_created", { template }, ctx)` — instead of restating `{ userId: ctx?.userEmail }` at every call site, and resolve the browser session from the ambient request context so no caller has to thread it. `TrackingEvent` carries it as a typed `sessionId` that each provider maps to its own field (`$session_id` for PostHog, a `session_id` property for Mixpanel and Amplitude, a top-level `sessionId` for webhooks and Agent-Native Analytics), rather than leaking one backend's reserved key into every other backend. The browser `track()` helper sends the session header too, so a client event and the server events from the same visit no longer land in different sessions.

  Let an app pin that id with `setAnalyticsSessionId()` (and drop it with `clearAnalyticsSessionId()`) from `@agent-native/core/client/analytics`. A pinned id opts out of the 30-minute idle rotation, so a workflow that spans a quiet stretch stays one correlated session instead of silently splitting in two. Ids the transport cannot carry — empty, over 127 characters, whitespace, or non-ASCII — throw at the call site rather than unlinking every later request.

## 0.143.0

### Minor Changes

- e177059: Export app-backed skills as standard Agent Plugins and import portable Skills and remote MCP servers into Agent-Native workspaces.

### Patch Changes

- 6ad7634: Refresh the dev server action registry when action files are added or removed so chat and action routes use the regenerated registry immediately.
- b872cde: Reduce serverless foreground database pools to leave connection headroom for warm user-facing instances while preserving the larger pool for durable workers.
- e177059: Discard pooled database clients when a transaction rollback fails.
- e177059: Keep self-dispatched background work on the current deployment and fail closed when a shared processor handoff cannot be signed.
- e177059: Use Netlify's durable cache for public SSR shells so edge misses reuse the shared response instead of invoking the serverless renderer again.
- e177059: Reap serverless database connections that remain idle inside a transaction after a worker is interrupted.

## 0.142.0

### Minor Changes

- 9d8ae68: Expose the `turn-into-app` workflow as a runtime skill and slash command in generated Agent-Native apps and workspaces.
- 9d8ae68: Expose the `turn-into-skill` workflow as a runtime skill and slash command in generated Agent-Native apps and workspaces.

### Patch Changes

- 9d8ae68: Align MCP connection suggestions with the shared chat composer and prevent integration fallback initials from showing through provider logos.
- 9d8ae68: Stop paying Clips' startup data work on every cold start. The boolean-column retype made eleven serialized `information_schema` round trips before the app could serve; it now makes one. The `recordings.org_id` backfill moved from the plugin body into a tracked migration, so it runs once instead of re-scanning for `org_id IS NULL` on every cold start.

  Log which model a delegated (A2A) turn resolved to and why. The interactive path already logged its model and source; this one logged neither, so "the same app answers me in 27 seconds but takes 5 minutes when another app asks it the same thing" could not be checked. The chat model picker is browser-local, so it reaches an interactive turn as the highest-precedence request model and never reaches a delegated turn at all. Production shows the two paths usually do resolve to the same model anyway (467 of 532 delegated runs), so this is a configuration inconsistency worth seeing rather than the explanation for slow cross-app calls.

  Stop a turn whose tool keeps failing the same way under different arguments. Both existing loop breakers key on the arguments as well as the tool, so they only catch a model that repeats itself verbatim — while a model that is genuinely lost does the opposite and keeps guessing, minting a fresh key every attempt so the count never fires. A tool that has rejected six attempts the same way now ends the turn regardless of how the arguments varied. The breaker also had to stop keying on the echoed arguments: schema rejections embed `Received: {…}`, so the error text differed on every attempt and the count never fired — measured at 400 turns before this, six after.

  Tell a delegated agent how long it actually has. "I ran out of time before finishing this step" was 39% of failed inbound cross-app tasks in a measured week, clustered at 35-46s against a 40-second foreground serverless wall — while the callee is handed a nominal 80 iterations and 750k tokens and plans against those. Production iterations measure ~34 seconds each, so a foreground chunk affords roughly one. The clock was already enforced correctly; the agent just could not see it.

  Count a repeated tool failure across chunk boundaries. The new argument-independent breaker was seeded fresh on every run-loop invocation, and a turn may chain 6 (foreground) or 20 (background) of them — so the real ceiling was 36 or 120 identical failures, not 6.

- aa24c7e: Stop replaying non-retryable database failures from agent chat and surface failed delegated agent calls as tool errors.
- aa24c7e: Suppress first-run onboarding while a Slides deck editor deep link is open.
- 4044d22: Stop `agent-native doctor` failing hosted builds on the database scaffold it ships with. `no-env-credentials` now allowlists two exact keys: `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` (the direct-connection peer of the already-allowlisted `DATABASE_URL`, used by drizzle-kit for migrations) and `FUSION_BRANCH_KIND` (Builder deploy metadata). Both are impersonal deploy vars, never per-user credentials. Before this, `drizzle.config.ts` and `scripts/maybe-migrate.mjs` produced three findings and — since `doctor.failOnBuild` now defaults to true — aborted the build of every hosted app with a database.
- 9d8ae68: Start new users on the Create account tab when magic-link authentication is enabled.
- 9d8ae68: Preserve PPTX slide timing metadata and paragraph boundaries during imports.
- 9d8ae68: Keep expanded left-drawer contents at a fixed width while the outer drawer animates open.
- 9d8ae68: Package the isolated browser runtime and its dependencies in Node serverless outputs so rendered website extraction remains available when a hosted browser is unavailable.

## 0.141.7

### Patch Changes

- abb0cf5: Stop ending long agent chat turns early. The client's whole-turn follow budget was shorter than a single background chunk the server is allowed to run, so turns that were still streaming were cut off; it is now a backstop above the server's own limits, with a test pinning that order. Also explains the gateway's email-verification block instead of showing a dead-end error, and no longer claims a stopped turn was looping when it was still working.

  Also require a provider key when an `ai-sdk:*` engine points at a public gateway. The keyless exemption was meant for a self-hosted gateway but accepted any `baseUrl`, so pointing at a hosted provider without a key sent an unauthenticated request that came back as `http_401` "Missing Authentication header" — a transport error naming the wrong cause, repeated on every retry. Only loopback, private-range, and `.local`/`.internal` hosts are exempt now.

  Record the cause when a background continuation handoff fails. The run went terminal with `error_code` and `error_detail` both NULL, so every query read it as a failure with no known cause and the real message was only recoverable by parsing the `diag_stage` JSON blob.

  Record why a cross-app (A2A) call ended on the `agent_call` event. The terminal code was already computed for telemetry but left off the persisted event, so a failed cross-app call was stored as "failed after N ms" with no reason — undiagnosable without a repro.

  Attach the remote task id to every cross-app call, not only failed ones. A call that succeeded slowly carried no task id, so the question worth asking about a four-minute A2A call — what was the other app doing? — could not be traced into that app's own task record.

- abb0cf5: Use `/sign-in` as the clean browser-facing sign-in URL across apps while retaining the legacy framework path for compatibility.
- abb0cf5: Explain MCP connection failures in the integrations list and let users reconnect saved integrations.
- abb0cf5: Simplify the magic-link sign-in screen with a Welcome heading, a Continue email action, and a progressive password fallback.
- abb0cf5: Add a shared browser-rendered website design-system extraction surface with computed visual tokens, component evidence, and bounded design.md summaries.

## 0.140.0

### Minor Changes

- 0c105dd: Brand Kits can store a design system's own named tokens, not just the seven color roles.

  `BrandKitData.tokens` holds `{ name, cssVar, value, type, group?, source? }` entries so an imported system keeps the vocabulary its team actually uses (`interactive-01`, `md-sys-color-primary-container`) instead of being squashed into `primary`/`secondary`/`accent`. A new `@agent-native/core/brand-kit/tokens` subpath exports the pure helpers: `normalizeBrandKitTokens` (which reports rejected entries rather than silently storing a subset), `parseBrandKitTokensFromCss`, `resolveBrandKitTokens`, `brandKitRoleTokens`, `groupBrandKitTokens`, `classifyBrandKitToken`, and the canonical `isSafeCssVarName` / `isSafeCssTokenValue` predicates.

  Kits with no stored `tokens` fall back to the names their `customCSS` declares, so existing Brand Kits gain named tokens without a migration.

## 0.139.0

### Minor Changes

- 008b97c: Add a transactional email catalog.

  Apps declare the transactional emails they send with `defineTransactionalEmail`
  from `@agent-native/core/email-catalog`, giving each one a stable id, a
  plain-language trigger, recipient and sender logic, and a preview rendered from
  dummy data. Three actions (`list-transactional-emails`,
  `render-transactional-email-preview`, `list-email-log`) mount into every app
  automatically, so the catalog is readable without each app opting in.

  `sendEmail` now accepts a `templateId`. It tags the message at the provider so
  delivery and open metrics attribute to one email instead of the whole account,
  and records every attempt — success and failure — to a new additive `email_log`
  table, which keeps send counts and last-sent independent of the provider's short
  activity retention window.

  Dispatch gains a Transactional email screen listing every app's emails with
  previews, send counts, open rates, and a per-message activity feed, plus a
  read-only detail page per email. Metrics distinguish "not yet sent" from "could
  not be read": an unreadable send log renders as unknown rather than zero, and an
  unconfigured provider surfaces the reason instead of a 0% open rate.

## 0.137.8

### Patch Changes

- 718f945: Stop stranding users on the loading spinner when the session endpoint is
  unreadable. `useSession` retried a failed `/_agent-native/auth/session` every
  second forever while holding `isLoading` true, so a transient 5xx, network
  failure, or timeout produced a spinner that never resolved and carried no error
  anywhere. It now retries a bounded number of times with backoff and then reports
  a distinct `status: "unavailable"` alongside the existing `session`/`isLoading`
  fields.

  `RequireSession` keys off that status: unreadable is no longer collapsed into
  signed-out (which would bounce a signed-in user to the sign-in page over a blip)
  nor into loading (which stranded them). It renders a notice with Try again and
  Reload actions instead.

  The `DefaultSpinner` stall hint is also environment-aware now. It previously
  told every visitor — including on hosted deployments — to "check the terminal
  running the dev server", which is meaningless outside local development.

### Patch Changes

- 34e3dc3: Keep needsApproval Approve/Deny visible

## 0.137.6

### Patch Changes

- bd50f3a: Fix a server hang caused by run reconciliation never reaching a fixed point. A run row already holding its reconciled terminal values still matched the repair UPDATE, and an unchanged rewrite counts as an affected row, so `reconcileTerminalRunFromEvents` reported a repair on every call. `getRunByThread` re-reconciles whenever a repair is reported, so a single settled `errored`/`stale_run` row made every lookup for that thread recurse without terminating, pinning the event loop and hanging all requests.

## 0.136.3

### Patch Changes

- d14fbb9: Keep the dev server's route table live when route files are added or deleted. React Router's framework-mode plugin invalidates its virtual modules through Vite's deprecated back-compat module graph, which proxies only the `client` and `ssr` environments — never the Nitro environment that actually serves SSR. The route table therefore froze at whatever it was when the dev server booted: a new route file 404'd forever, and deleting one left the stale manifest importing a file that no longer existed, so every page returned `Internal Server Error: Failed to load url … Does the file exist?` until the process was restarted. Agent-Native now mirrors that invalidation into every environment and reloads the affected server runners. Also escapes control bytes in dev SSR error bodies, so Vite's NUL-prefixed virtual-module ids print as `\0virtual:react-router/server-build` instead of making `curl` treat the response as binary and hide the only line describing the failure.

## 0.136.2

### Patch Changes

- d6e7c5c: Recommend Playwright's headless shell instead of the full headed browser wherever a missing-browser message or install script tells you to run `playwright install chromium`, and say what the full download costs.
- d6e7c5c: Stop shipping unused Playwright packages to consumers. `@agent-native/core`
  declared `playwright` in both `devDependencies` and `optionalDependencies`
  without ever importing it at runtime; the optional entry is gone, so it no
  longer installs for every consumer. `@agent-native/recap-cli` no longer
  declares `@playwright/test` as an optional dependency — its sibling `playwright`
  optional dependency always resolved first, so the `@playwright/test` fallback
  import could never be reached. That fallback now rethrows the original
  `playwright` failure instead of a misleading "cannot find `@playwright/test`".
- d6e7c5c: Keep the dev server's route table live when route files are added or deleted. React Router's framework-mode plugin invalidates its virtual modules through Vite's deprecated back-compat module graph, which proxies only the `client` and `ssr` environments — never the Nitro environment that actually serves SSR. The route table therefore froze at whatever it was when the dev server booted: a new route file 404'd forever, and deleting one left the stale manifest importing a file that no longer existed, so every page returned `Internal Server Error: Failed to load url … Does the file exist?` until the process was restarted.

Also escapes control bytes in dev SSR error bodies, so Vite's NUL-prefixed virtual-module ids print as `\0virtual:react-router/server-build` instead of making `curl` treat the response as binary and hide the only line describing the failure.
- d6e7c5c: Add Gong keyword-tracker and staged corpus guidance to the provider API catalog.
- d6e7c5c: Prefer GPT-5.6 Luna for default server-side voice transcript cleanup when a
  Luna-capable provider is available, while keeping audio transcription and
  explicit Gemini provider selections unchanged.
- d6e7c5c: Stop a second Chromium from being downloaded alongside the one already on disk.

  First-party workspace packages now take Playwright from an exact catalog pin, so
  a caret cannot resolve forward to a release tied to a different Chromium
  revision. The two packages that declare Playwright as a published optional
  dependency — `@agent-native/creative-context` and `@agent-native/recap-cli` —
  deliberately keep a caret range instead: an exact range in a library stops a
  consumer who already has a different Playwright from deduping, which forces a
  nested copy and downloads exactly the second browser this change exists to
  avoid.

- 74f1e73: Scoped agent-access tokens can carry a signed `agentLabel` claim, so apps can name the agent a link was minted for instead of guessing from the user-agent. Like `viewerEmail`, it is audit/display-only and never consulted for authorisation.

## 0.136.1

### Patch Changes

- db4b4f0: Allow native OAuth clients to use ephemeral ports on registered HTTP loopback redirect URIs while rejecting fragments and userinfo.

## 0.136.0

### Minor Changes

- 2b6fea3: Fix the Automations page reporting runs that never happened, and add run history and schedule editing.

  A scheduler or dispatcher tick that declined to run an automation used to stamp
  `lastRun` with the current time, so a permanently blocked automation reported a
  fresh run every minute while its `nextRun` stayed frozen in the past. Skipped
  ticks now record `lastCheck` instead, leave `lastRun` alone, and only rewrite the
  resource when the failure state actually changes. The failure reason
  (`lastError`) is surfaced on the row and in the details view instead of being
  swallowed behind a bare `skipped` chip.

  Schedules are also timezone-aware. Cron expressions used to be read in the
  server's zone, so an automation created as "every day at 8am" ran at 8am UTC.
  A schedule now stores the IANA zone it was written in, taken from a new
  scheduling timezone preference in Account settings and falling back to the
  caller's browser zone. Descriptions name their zone ("Every day at 8 AM
  (America/New_York)"), and both the agent tools and the schedule editor accept a
  timezone. Existing schedules keep their current host-relative meaning until
  edited.

  Also adds:
  - `automation_runs` history for real executions, exposed through a new
    `list-automation-runs` action and a Past runs section in the details view.
  - A Details view that shows more than the list row: schedule, next/last run,
    last checked, last status, scope, creator and model.
  - An Edit affordance for changing a scheduled automation's cron expression and
    timezone.
  - A "Manage agent" entry in the sidebar organization switcher.

  Run history is bounded and honest about interrupted runs: a row left `running`
  past the point a run could still be alive is reported as `interrupted` rather
  than shown as permanently in-flight, and rows are pruned per automation so a
  frequent schedule cannot grow the table without limit. Recording a run's
  outcome also re-reads the automation first, so a schedule edited while it was
  running is no longer reverted by the completion write.

  Also from review: a completion write no longer recreates an automation deleted
  mid-run, a run-history write failure can no longer reclassify a completed
  automation as failed, deleting an automation forgets its run history so a new
  one reusing the name does not inherit it, an unusable `X-User-Timezone` header
  is rejected rather than persisted, and a settings read failure surfaces instead
  of silently pinning a schedule to the host zone.

  Run history never blocks the automation it describes: opening the record,
  attaching its thread and closing it out are all non-fatal, so an unwritable
  history table costs the record rather than the run.

### Patch Changes

- 2b6fea3: Cache peer agent cards instead of re-probing every sibling app on each lookup.
  `describe-workspace-apps` ships in the default first-request tool set and the
  `<available-apps>` prompt block names it, so a single turn could probe every
  peer and the next turn would do it all again. Against a local dev gateway each
  probe also cold-starts the app it touches, so one tool call spawned a dev server
  per sibling at once and the machine stalled behind them. Cards are now cached
  per caller for 30s with concurrent probes collapsed onto one request; failures
  expire after 5s so a peer that was still booting is retried promptly rather than
  being reported skill-less.
- 2b6fea3: Add `agent-native clean` to reclaim disk from regenerable build caches, and report disk usage in `agent-native doctor`. `clean` is a dry run unless `--apply`, prints the bytes it reclaims per category, and surfaces any delete it could not complete instead of reporting a clean total. It refuses any root it cannot confirm is an Agent-Native project — a `package.json` that parses and depends on `@agent-native/core`, an `agent-native.json`, or a workspace with an app under `apps/` that has either; a manifest it cannot read or parse is a refusal naming the file and the reason, never a permit. Every target is a real directory entry matched by exact name, so a hand-written `Build/` is not selected by the `build` rule on a case-insensitive filesystem, and each one is re-checked against the identity recorded at scan time immediately before the delete, so a parent swapped mid-run is a reported failure rather than a delete somewhere else. It treats an unknown flag or a valueless `--cwd` as a usage error rather than guessing, and counts a hard-linked file only when every link to it is inside the delete set — one deploy bundle linked into several function directories counts once, and one still linked from `node_modules/` counts nothing, because removing it frees nothing. A byte is credited only where the run observed it removed, so an outcome it could not observe is a typed result rather than a number: a tree another process deleted first — a second `clean`, or Vite recreating `.vite` mid re-optimize — credits nothing instead of two runs both claiming it, a target already gone when re-checked is a no-op rather than a failure, a re-measure that cannot read what survived reports the bytes as unknown rather than as zero, and a scan stopped by the walk-depth cap says so instead of returning a short total. Under `apps/`, each app must confirm for itself that it is Agent-Native before anything inside it is selected, so one app no longer licenses deleting a sibling Rust project's `build/` or a personal folder's `dist/`. Protected names — `data/`, `.git`, `node_modules`, `.env*` — now match case-insensitively while targets stay case-exact, so `Data/` is not descended into on a case-insensitive filesystem. The walk and the delete stop at a filesystem mount boundary. One unreadable directory is reported once rather than once per pass, a partial run's headline states the exact shortfall rather than rounding to look complete, and `--json --help` answers in JSON. `doctor` now shows free space on the volume holding the project and flags low free space; `doctor --disk` also measures how much `clean` could give back.
- 2b6fea3: Keep workspace development lazy by default so unused apps do not build Vite
  dependency caches and consume disk and memory. Background prewarming remains
  available with `--prewarm` or `WORKSPACE_PREWARM=1`.
- 2b6fea3: Fail closed when an `ai-sdk:*` engine has no provider key, instead of sending an
  unauthenticated request. The provider factory was previously built with no
  `apiKey`, so the SDK omitted the Authorization header and the gateway's 401 came
  back as `http_401` "Missing Authentication header" — a transport error naming the
  wrong cause, which a scheduled job then retried on every tick forever. It now
  reports `missing_credentials` and names the env var it wants, matching what
  `builder-engine` and `anthropic-engine` already did.

  Also stop reaping in-process background automations (scheduler and trigger runs)
  at the tight 45s post-claim stale window. That window exists to reach a durable
  successor sooner, but these runs carry no `dispatch_payload` and have no
  successor to reach, so an early reap killed still-working jobs that nothing could
  recover. They now get the 90s background window, and the recovery path reports
  `not_redispatchable` rather than `payload_missing`, which read as data loss for
  the one case where nothing was ever lost.

- 2b6fea3: Stop writing a second full copy of the server bundle for every extra Netlify
  function. The durable-background, integration-recovery, workspace
  `<app>-server`, and Vercel `<app>-server.func` emits now share one on-disk copy
  through hard links, so a build no longer doubles (or, in a workspace, multiplies)
  its function output. Each function still ships a complete, independent bundle —
  only the wasted disk goes away. Builds also stop emitting the throwaway
  `dist/<app>/<app>` client build for presets that already mount `publicDir` at the
  app base path.
- 2b6fea3: Harden hosted authentication and preview database isolation against account-claim exposure.
- 2b6fea3: Stop writing sourcemaps into the Vite dependency pre-bundle cache, which roughly halves `node_modules/.vite/deps` (and the transient double-size peak during a re-optimize) so workspaces stop running out of disk. Set `AGENT_NATIVE_DEP_SOURCEMAPS=1` to restore them when stepping into third-party code in the debugger.
- 2b6fea3: Stop workspaces from accumulating duplicate physical copies of
  `@agent-native/core`.

  `agent-native upgrade` now rewrites the `latest` specs it installs back to the
  exact resolved versions, so a committed manifest pins one release instead of
  re-resolving on every install. If a version cannot be read after a successful
  install, upgrade reports which specs are still floating rather than claiming
  the upgrade finished. A `package.json` that cannot be parsed is now named in
  that report and stops the run, instead of being skipped as if it were clean.

  Apps added to an existing workspace inherit the framework versions the
  workspace root already pins, and freshly scaffolded workspaces resolve
  `@types/node`, `esbuild`, `srvx`, and `zod` once workspace-wide. `typescript`
  is no longer a peer dependency of core — core never imported it, and the peer
  edge forked a separate ~175 MB copy of core per TypeScript version in use.

- 2b6fea3: Keep the full Agent workspace reachable from chat-only sidebars, including generated migrated apps. The sidebar link now opens the Agent page where context, resources, connections, automations, and access are managed.
- 2b6fea3: Allow organization owners and admins to require Google sign-in, revoke current sessions when enabled, and enforce the policy across all auth entry points.
- 2b6fea3: Keep local package linking fast and deterministic when scaffolding during framework development.
- 2b6fea3: Keep scaffolded workspaces compatible with the current h3 and srvx releases.
- 2b6fea3: Share the browser's realtime sync transport across feature subscribers and reconnect local SSE streams after terminal failures.
- 2b6fea3: Share one sync stream per origin across browser tabs instead of opening one per
  tab. The browser caps HTTP/1.1 connections at roughly six per origin per browser
  process, so every extra tab's EventSource permanently consumed one of them and
  ordinary requests queued behind the held streams — worst in local development,
  where the dev gateway serves every workspace app from a single origin. Tabs now
  elect a stream holder through Web Locks and receive its frames over
  BroadcastChannel; followers relax to the fallback poll cadence, and Web Locks
  promotes a new holder automatically when that tab closes. Browsers without Web
  Locks or BroadcastChannel keep the previous per-tab behavior.
- 2b6fea3: Make browser Demo mode visible in the shared organization switcher, explain what it changes, and avoid showing the redacted anonymous email as the signed-in identity.
- 2b6fea3: Shrink the published package by roughly 47 MB of allocated disk per install.
  Source maps, the `corpus/core` and `corpus/toolkit` trees, and the `src/` tree
  were three separate copies of source that already ships as `dist/`, `docs/`, and
  `@agent-native/toolkit`'s own `src/`. The tarball now ships only the eject
  entries and scaffolding templates out of `src/`, and `corpus/` carries the
  first-party template source that `source-search` actually reads. Docs and
  `source-search` now point at `dist/` for framework internals instead of a corpus
  path that no longer exists.
- 2b6fea3: Forward incremental action input to browser chat surfaces so apps can preview generated content while an action is being prepared.

### Patch Changes

- ed51b3d: Grant org-visibility access on shareable resources based on the caller's real organization membership, instead of only their currently active organization. Fixes real org members being denied access to org-shared resources (e.g. recordings) when a different org happened to be active in their session.

## 0.135.0

### Minor Changes

- 41544d8: Fix the Automations page reporting runs that never happened, and add run history and schedule editing.

  A scheduler or dispatcher tick that declined to run an automation used to stamp
  `lastRun` with the current time, so a permanently blocked automation reported a
  fresh run every minute while its `nextRun` stayed frozen in the past. Skipped
  ticks now record `lastCheck` instead, leave `lastRun` alone, and only rewrite the
  resource when the failure state actually changes. The failure reason
  (`lastError`) is surfaced on the row and in the details view instead of being
  swallowed behind a bare `skipped` chip.

  Schedules are also timezone-aware. Cron expressions used to be read in the
  server's zone, so an automation created as "every day at 8am" ran at 8am UTC.
  A schedule now stores the IANA zone it was written in, taken from a new
  scheduling timezone preference in Account settings and falling back to the
  caller's browser zone. Descriptions name their zone ("Every day at 8 AM
  (America/New_York)"), and both the agent tools and the schedule editor accept a
  timezone. Existing schedules keep their current host-relative meaning until
  edited.

  Also adds:
  - `automation_runs` history for real executions, exposed through a new
    `list-automation-runs` action and a Past runs section in the details view.
  - A Details view that shows more than the list row: schedule, next/last run,
    last checked, last status, scope, creator and model.
  - An Edit affordance for changing a scheduled automation's cron expression and
    timezone.
  - A "Manage agent" entry in the sidebar organization switcher.

  Run history is bounded and honest about interrupted runs: a row left `running`
  past the point a run could still be alive is reported as `interrupted` rather
  than shown as permanently in-flight, and rows are pruned per automation so a
  frequent schedule cannot grow the table without limit. Recording a run's
  outcome also re-reads the automation first, so a schedule edited while it was
  running is no longer reverted by the completion write.

  Also from review: a completion write no longer recreates an automation deleted
  mid-run, a run-history write failure can no longer reclassify a completed
  automation as failed, deleting an automation forgets its run history so a new
  one reusing the name does not inherit it, an unusable `X-User-Timezone` header
  is rejected rather than persisted, and a settings read failure surfaces instead
  of silently pinning a schedule to the host zone.

  Run history never blocks the automation it describes: opening the record,
  attaching its thread and closing it out are all non-fatal, so an unwritable
  history table costs the record rather than the run.

- 8c37661: Add shared settings and activity-notification primitives.
  - `SettingsGroup` / `SettingsRow` (`@agent-native/core/client/settings`) render
    several one-line settings inside a single card instead of one card per
    control. Each row keeps its own `id`, so existing settings-search hashes
    still resolve after a card collapses into a row.
  - `resolveActivityRecipients` and `notifyActivity`
    (`@agent-native/core/server`) resolve who should receive a collaboration
    email — owner, thread participants, mentions, never the actor — filter them
    by an app-owned preference key, and report delivery as `delivered`,
    `delivery-failed`, `no-recipients`, `email-not-configured`, or
    `notification-error` rather than collapsing them into an empty success. A
    batch where every send threw is reported as `delivery-failed`, never as a
    delivery.
  - `runActivityNotification` (`@agent-native/core/server`) runs a notification
    without letting it reject the write that caused it. The comment is already
    persisted when notification runs, so throwing made the client retry and
    duplicate the row; the failure now surfaces as `notification-error`.
  - `filterRecipientsByResourceAccess` (`@agent-native/core/sharing`) keeps only
    the addresses that can open a resource right now. Notification recipients
    come from history — stored mentions, past thread authors — and none of that
    is an access grant, so mentioning an arbitrary address no longer mails it the
    comment body and a revoked collaborator stops receiving the thread.
  - `isOrgMember` (`@agent-native/core/org`) is now one exported resolver instead
    of two private copies of the same query.
  - Review threads now send comment, reply, and mention emails from core
    (`notifyReviewComment`), so every app built on the review surface gets them.
    `ReviewableResourceRegistration` gained an optional `resolveUrl` so those
    emails can deep-link to the resource instead of the app root.

- f499dff: Add `@agent-native/core/vitest-config`, a base vitest config that caps a suite's
  worker pool so concurrent test runs no longer oversubscribe the CPU. Defaults to
  25% of cores; override with `VITEST_CONCURRENCY`. Every template and package
  config merges it in.

## 0.134.2

### Patch Changes

- 10a204a: Brand transactional auth emails per app. Signup verification and password
  reset emails now send from `<app-slug>@agent-native.com` with reply-to
  agent-native@builder.io and per-app subjects/headings ("Verify your email for
  Agent-Native <App>" / "Reset your Agent-Native <App> password"). The
  verification email body also includes the app's one-line description (competitor
  names reframed as "replacement"); the reset email omits the pitch since it's a
  security email. Unknown apps fall back to the generic "Agent-Native" branding.

  The branded sender and reply-to are applied only when the configured
  EMAIL_FROM is already on agent-native.com, so self-hosted deployments keep
  their own verified sender and support mailbox.

## 0.134.1

### Patch Changes

- 6c165cd: Document the permission-aware Content database membership removal action.

## 0.134.0

### Minor Changes

- 46cd162: Make PostHog a first-class error-reporting and LLM-observability backend, and fix
  the malformed exception events it was already receiving.

  `captureException()` emitted an event named `$exception` carrying camelCase
  properties. PostHog ingests anything by that name and renders it as an issue, but
  it groups and symbolicates from `$exception_list` — so every PostHog-configured
  app was already collecting exceptions that arrived empty and ungroupable, which
  reads as coverage rather than as a failure. The PostHog provider now reshapes
  those into a real `$exception_list` with parsed stack frames.

  Route errors no longer depend on Sentry. The Nitro `error` hook lived inside
  `sentry-plugin.ts`, which returns early when no `SENTRY_DSN` is set, so an app
  running PostHog alone reported no route errors at all. The hook moved to
  `core-routes-plugin.ts` and goes through the provider-agnostic `captureError()`
  registry, so every configured backend receives it. The ~150 lines of
  production-tuned drop rules (expected 4xx, permission rejections, Lambda
  freeze/thaw `socket hang up`) moved out of Sentry's `beforeSend` into
  `server/error-noise-filter.ts` and now apply to every backend — without them a
  second backend receives a firehose. Server exceptions are also attributed to the
  in-flight user instead of landing under `anonymous`.

  Browser exceptions go to PostHog when `POSTHOG_PUBLIC_KEY` / `VITE_POSTHOG_KEY`
  is set, posted directly rather than relayed through `/_agent-native/track`, which
  requires a session and would drop every signed-out crash. `POSTHOG_API_KEY` is
  deliberately not a fallback for the public key: that value is inlined into the
  public HTML shell. Note that PostHog does not symbolicate without uploaded source
  maps, so minified browser stacks stay minified.

  LLM observability now emits the full PostHog trace tree. Previously a run
  produced a single `$ai_generation` labelled `agent_run` whose `$ai_parent_id`
  pointed at a span that was never sent, so PostHog wrapped it in a placeholder
  trace with no steps. Runs now emit `$ai_trace`, one `$ai_span` per tool call, and
  a generation parented to the trace. Tool calls ship inside `$ai_output_choices`
  even with content capture off, because that is the only thing PostHog derives
  `$ai_tools_called` from. The previously dead `capturePrompts` flag is now wired
  and gates `$ai_input` and assistant text; disabled fields are omitted rather than
  sent empty, and oversized content is replaced with an explicit truncation marker
  instead of being silently shortened. `$ai_error` became a structured object with
  the terminal code and retryability, and errors captured during a run carry the
  run's `$ai_trace_id` so an issue and its trace resolve to each other.

  Feedback previously emitted only for thumbs; category and free-text submissions
  emitted nothing. All four now report, with `sentiment` still limited to thumbs so
  a category follow-up does not double-count the vote. PostHog surfaces feedback in
  LLM analytics only through a `survey sent` event, so that is emitted too when
  `POSTHOG_AI_FEEDBACK_SURVEY_ID` is configured — and not at all when it is unset,
  rather than inventing a survey id.

  Agent traces carry the browser session as `$session_id` (read from a new
  `X-Agent-Native-Session-Id` header) so a trace joins its session replay, distinct
  from `$ai_session_id`, which remains the conversation thread.

## 0.133.2

### Patch Changes

- 3fac05d: Ensure Netlify-hosted integration calls hand off slow cross-app work to durable delivery when only runtime markers are available.

## 0.133.1

### Patch Changes

- 1c08605: Fail closed when an `ai-sdk:*` engine has no provider key, instead of sending an
  unauthenticated request. The provider factory was previously built with no
  `apiKey`, so the SDK omitted the Authorization header and the gateway's 401 came
  back as `http_401` "Missing Authentication header" — a transport error naming the
  wrong cause, which a scheduled job then retried on every tick forever. It now
  reports `missing_credentials` and names the env var it wants, matching what
  `builder-engine` and `anthropic-engine` already did.

  Also stop reaping in-process background automations (scheduler and trigger runs)
  at the tight 45s post-claim stale window. That window exists to reach a durable
  successor sooner, but these runs carry no `dispatch_payload` and have no
  successor to reach, so an early reap killed still-working jobs that nothing could
  recover. They now get the 90s background window, and the recovery path reports
  `not_redispatchable` rather than `payload_missing`, which read as data loss for
  the one case where nothing was ever lost.

## 0.133.0

### Minor Changes

- eecd3ad: Expose the measured agent failure taxonomy and let thread diagnostics separate interactive runs from scheduled `job-` runs.

### Patch Changes

- eecd3ad: Let a delegated A2A run inherit the caller's model when the receiving app never
  picked one. A cross-app turn resolved its model entirely on the receiving side,
  and the stored lookup is scoped to the receiver's own app id — so selecting
  Sonnet in Slides still ran any question Slides delegated to Analytics on
  Analytics' default. Nothing in the request carried the caller's choice.

  `call-agent` now sends the model it is running on as `callerModel` in the
  existing A2A correlation metadata, and the receiver applies it strictly last
  before its default: explicit config, then its own stored setting, then the
  hint. An app that deliberately pins a model keeps it; the hint only fills the
  gap where the receiver would otherwise take a default it never chose.

  The hint is a preference, never an authorization. It is bounded to the
  receiver's already-resolved engine catalog by `resolveDelegatedRunModel`, so a
  peer cannot move the run to another provider, an unknown id, or a capability
  tier the engine does not offer; engines that cannot prove membership (empty
  catalog, OpenAI-compatible gateway) take no hint at all. A rejected hint is
  logged and dropped rather than failing the delegated run, and it stays out of
  every identity, org, access, and approval path.

- eecd3ad: Classify AI SDK provider failures that arrive as a stream part, not a throw.
  `streamText` does not throw for a failed provider request — it emits an `error`
  part on `fullStream` — so provider HTTP failures had two arrival paths and only
  the thrown one was classified. The stream-part path built a bare stop event from
  the message alone, discarding the `APICallError`'s `statusCode` and
  `isRetryable`. Everything downstream then had nothing structured to read: a 429
  or 503 was retried only if its prose happened to contain "rate_limit" or
  "overloaded", and the run persisted `error_code = 'unknown'`.

  That is also why a 100%-reproducible config 400 could run for three days across
  five apps without anyone noticing: it was indistinguishable in the outcome
  tables from every other unclassified failure, so it had no signature to alert
  on.

  Both paths now share one `classifyProviderError` helper — status code →
  `http_<status>`, transport failure → `provider_network_error`, `isRetryable`
  passed through, and a message-based fallback when the provider sent nothing
  structured. Every ai-sdk provider (openai, anthropic, google, openrouter, groq,
  mistral, cohere, ollama) gets correct classification at once.

- eecd3ad: Recover chats from transient provider failures instead of ending them. A
  provider transport blip reached persistence with no structured error code and
  was stored as `unknown`, which the client does not list as auto-recoverable —
  so the turn died where the identical failure carrying its real code resumes. In
  production this was measurable: `unknown` runs averaged exactly 1.00 runs per
  turn (no recovery was ever attempted), against 2.0 for `provider_network_error`
  and 1.5 for `http_429` on the same underlying errors.

  Four divergent copies of the connection-error predicate had drifted apart, and
  they disagreed on the exact string the AI SDK actually throws — `RetryError`
  reports `"Failed after 2 attempts. Last error: Cannot connect to API: …"`, which
  a copy anchored with `startsWith` scored as unclassified while a copy using
  `includes` scored as retryable. They are now one exported classifier in
  `engine/error-detail.ts`, matched against the error's full cause chain, and
  applied both where the error event is built (the code the client reads) and
  where the run's terminal code is persisted. Transport and capacity failures map
  to their real codes; deterministic failures stay unmapped so a broken request
  still stops the chat instead of spiralling.

  Also stop sending `reasoning_effort` alongside function tools for GPT models on
  the Builder gateway. The gateway routes them to Chat Completions, which rejects
  that combination outright, so every agent turn on a `gpt-5.x` model failed
  deterministically. Omitting the field does not help — only the explicit `"none"`
  clears it, matching the guard the AI SDK engine already had.

- eecd3ad: Fail closed instead of silently ignoring a broken cross-isolate Stop check: a rejected abort-state read in the agent run manager no longer gets coerced into "not aborted" forever — sustained read failures now self-abort the run with a distinct, typed error. Also add the same fail-closed handling to two `isTurnAborted` call sites in the background-dispatch path that were missing it, matching the existing sibling call sites.
- eecd3ad: Stop raw provider error text (a JSON error body, an SSL handshake failure) from
  being persisted as the visible assistant reply. The server-side rebuild of an
  assistant message (`buildAssistantMessage`, used by every background/durable
  run, reconnect-after-disconnect, poller-triggered turn, and webhook-triggered
  turn) appended `event.error` verbatim, unlike the live client which already
  routes it through `normalizeChatError`/`formatChatErrorText` for friendly copy.
  The rebuild now uses that same layer, so persisted text always matches what a
  live client would have shown, and the raw diagnostic is kept only in
  `runError.details`.
- eecd3ad: Name the two deterministic provider failures that were ending chats as `unknown`: a model rejecting tools alongside `reasoning_effort`, and a missing authentication header. Both now carry a real error code and user-facing copy that says what to change, and both stay non-recoverable so nothing retries a failure a retry cannot fix.
- eecd3ad: Preserve Builder design-system source provenance on local proxy references.
- eecd3ad: Keep the signup email visible when an email-verification link opens a new tab, so the follow-up sign-in targets the verified account instead of a browser-autofilled address.
- eecd3ad: Fix a split-brain in credential resolution: `resolveCredential` (and its diagnostic sibling `describeCredentialScopeGap`) only ever searched the single org on `ctx.orgId`. Interactive requests always populate it, but CLI runs, cron/recurring jobs, and any other caller built from `getCredentialContext()` outside a request event do not — so an org-scoped key that shows "Ready" in Settings silently missed at runtime for those callers. Both functions now fall back to resolving the caller's org from their email when `ctx.orgId` is unset, and a membership lookup that fails to read now throws a retryable error instead of being reported as "not configured". `resolveRequiredCredential` in the provider-api layer now also appends the scope-gap diagnostic to its error, matching `resolveAnyCredential`.
- eecd3ad: Mark exhausted in-process agent-loop budgets as non-recoverable so the client does not restart the same exhausted run.
- eecd3ad: Run scheduled jobs, automations, and Google Docs comment replies under the background timeout regime instead of the interactive one. They were inheriting the 40s soft timeout, a 30s no-progress backstop, and 6 continuations meant for a synchronous request, so work that legitimately spends minutes across many tool calls died in the first gap longer than 30s and was recorded as `no_progress`.
- eecd3ad: Stop scheduled jobs and event automations from being killed mid-run as
  "background_worker_never_started". `runBackgroundAutomation` (shared by
  `jobs/scheduler.ts` and `triggers/dispatcher.ts`) executes entirely
  in-process — there is no HTTP self-dispatch — but still marked its run row
  `dispatch_mode = 'background'` for the wider stale window, without ever
  calling `claimBackgroundRun` the way a genuine HTTP background worker does.
  That left the row parked at the transient `'background'` state for the run's
  entire life, indistinguishable from a lost HTTP handoff: the unclaimed-
  background-run sweep reaps any such row past its 25s grace window, so a
  single tool call running past 25s (routine for a report or analytics job)
  got the still-executing run errored out from under it, discarding whatever
  it later completed with.

  The runner now self-claims its row into `'background-processing'`
  immediately after inserting it — the same claimed state a real HTTP worker
  reaches — which removes it from the unclaimed-sweep's eligibility (it filters
  on `dispatch_mode = 'background'` exactly) and puts it under the wider,
  heartbeat-driven stale window instead, with the correct `stale_run` code if
  it ever genuinely dies.

- eecd3ad: Stop resending a Builder credential the gateway already rejected. Every non-Builder provider already skipped a key marked bad by an auth failure; Builder credential selection (`resolveScopedBuilderCredentials`/`resolveBuilderCredentialsDetailed` in user/org/workspace/solo scope and the deploy-env fallback, plus `hasUsableBuilderConnection` and the env-detection path in the engine registry) now consults that same marker and falls through to the next scope instead of resending the identical known-bad key on every live and scheduled turn.
- eecd3ad: Fix the Slack bot answering as the wrong app and silently dropping mentions

  Outbound Slack delivery never passed an app id, so token resolution fell back
  to a team-only lookup that took whichever installation was updated most
  recently. A workspace with two connected Slack apps posted as whichever one
  reconnected last. Outbound targets can now name an installation, and an
  ambiguous tenant is reported instead of resolved to an arbitrary app.

  Webhook dispatch also discarded a definitive `failed` outcome and answered the
  platform 200 regardless, leaving a queued task nobody was running behind an
  in-progress indicator that never resolved. That failure is now surfaced to the
  user, and stuck-task recovery sweeps every dispatch mode rather than only
  durable scopes — portable dispatch is the mode most likely to strand a task,
  since its self-dispatch dies with the container.

- eecd3ad: Stop a retry storm from deleting the answer the user already read. A rebuild
  correctly refuses to apply a _trailing_ `clear` — there is no successor chunk to
  re-emit what it wipes — but it only skipped the clear at the very last index.
  Each failed engine attempt emits its own `clear`, so three failures in a row is
  the ordinary shape, and the rebuild still applied the first two, splicing every
  text and reasoning part out of the run. When the run had made no tool calls this
  emptied the content entirely and the builder returned null, so the user's
  message was persisted with no assistant reply at all. The whole trailing run of
  clears is now skipped; a `clear` with real events after it still applies.

  Also make `terminal_reason` write-once on an already-terminal row. Three writers
  in three isolates race on that column — the mid-run checkpoint, the run-manager's
  finalization, and the background worker's failure path — with no ordering
  between them, and last-writer-wins let a late checkpoint relabel a run another
  isolate had already finalized. That produced impossible rows (`status='errored'`
  carrying a continuation reason, no `error_code`, no terminal event) and
  misattributed 130 production runs to a failure mode they never hit. A row that
  is still `running` has no honest reason yet and stays writable.

- eecd3ad: Stop the unclaimed-background-run sweep from destroying the runs it exists to
  recover. Its redispatch asserted `payloadRef: true` without checking the row
  still carried a `dispatch_payload`, but sweep eligibility never implied one —
  a background row can reach the grace window having never had a payload at all.
  The redispatched worker then could not rehydrate a request body and failed the
  run as `dispatch_payload_missing`, a reason that reads like data loss for what
  is really an un-redispatchable handoff. That path accounted for 98 failed
  production runs, every one of them a scheduled job.

  `listUnclaimedBackgroundRunRows` now reports payload presence per row (it
  reports rather than filters, so a payload-less row stays visible to the slow
  sweep and cannot be stranded in `running` forever). The fast sweep skips those
  rows, and the slow sweep sends them straight to its existing loud reap instead
  of waiting out the redispatch bound first — the run still fails, because
  nothing can rehydrate it, but with its true cause
  (`background_worker_never_started`, which the client treats as recoverable).

## 0.132.2

### Patch Changes

- 3aa3c49: Keep each resource's agent chat to itself instead of showing one chat everywhere.

  A chat thread's `scope` carried two meanings at once: "general chat, visible in
  every resource" and "nobody has told the server this thread's scope yet". Because
  those were indistinguishable, a thread that lost its scope silently became a
  permanent global chat — it followed the user into every design/deck/form, and
  because an unscoped chat is allowed to stay visible, no per-resource chat was ever
  started.

  Two paths dropped the scope. The server created the row on the first message
  without one (`persistSubmittedUserMessage`), even though the client already sends
  it and `production-agent` had already normalized it onto
  `RequestRunContext.chatScope` — nothing read that field. The client then asserted
  `scope: null` on every save for any thread missing from its local list, which the
  `PUT` applies unconditionally, cementing the null.

  Now the run's scope is used when the row is created, a thread with no scope adopts
  the scope of the resource it is used in (`resolveRunThreadScope`, which never
  retags or clears an already-scoped thread), and the client only mirrors a scope it
  actually knows. Adoption also heals threads already stored with `scope: null`, and
  claims the row with a compare-and-set on the unscoped state so two workers racing
  to adopt the same legacy thread cannot retag it to the wrong resource.

  Scope now rides only on thread creation: a periodic save no longer sends it, so a
  stale client guess cannot move an existing thread between resources, and
  `detachThread` is the only client path that clears one. A restored active-chat
  pointer is checked against the thread's real scope on a direct mount as well as
  when moving between resources — and because the thread list is one page, a pointer
  naming a thread the page did not reach is resolved by id rather than assumed to be
  a never-messaged local tab.

  Genuinely general chats are unaffected until they are used inside a resource.

## 0.132.1

### Patch Changes

- 548844d: Fix agent tool calls failing against discriminated-union action schemas. Gateway-supplied empty placeholders are now stripped from nested objects and union branches (not just top-level fields), `oneOf` validation errors report only the branch the discriminator selects, and the expected-signature hint expands array items and union branches so nested enums are spelled out.

## 0.132.0

### Minor Changes

- 89e5910: Enable durable agent-chat background runs by default for deployed Netlify apps, with an explicit opt-out.

### Patch Changes

- 89e5910: Batch application-state reads. `GET /_agent-native/application-state?keys=a,b,c`
  returns many keys in one request, and `readClientAppState` coalesces reads
  issued in the same tick into that single call, so a page load no longer pays one
  HTTP round trip and one full identity resolution per key. The response reports
  absent keys in `missing` rather than as `null` values, keeping "never written"
  distinguishable from "written as null or empty"; the single-key routes are
  unchanged.
- 89e5910: Cut database round trips on the status endpoints a page load hits repeatedly.
  - Added `prefetchSecrets(keys)`, which warms the per-request secret memo with
    one batched read per scope instead of one read per key per scope, and used it
    in `/_agent-native/env-status` (48 single-key `app_secrets` selects per request
    → 4 batched) and `/_agent-native/voice-providers/status` (19 → 4).
  - The change marker after an action now honours a per-call Plan-mode `effect`
    before the action-level `readOnly` flag. A status poll shaped as a mutating
    action — `manage-agent-engine` with `action: "list"`, polled every few seconds
    — no longer bumps the `"action"` change version, so queries keyed on it stop
    refetching on an idle page.
  - The default database schema health probe runs its table checks in parallel and
    memoizes a clean result for a few seconds. A probe reporting a missing table or
    an unreadable database is never memoized.

- 89e5910: Record tool arguments and result summaries in delegated-run traces. The A2A
  agent-activity snapshot and the agent-team / harness background transcripts now
  carry each tool call's arguments and a result preview in redacted, size-capped
  form, so a delegated run that loops on the same tool is diagnosable from what
  was recorded instead of needing a fresh repro. Captures reuse the audit
  redaction helper (credential-looking keys and values become `[redacted]`),
  oversized values keep an explicit `…(N more chars)` / `_auditTruncated` marker,
  and a shared per-snapshot payload budget keeps the activity part inside its
  wire limit.
- 89e5910: Share one Postgres connection pool per URL across the whole process instead of
  building a separate one for the `getDbExec` singleton, Better Auth, and every
  `createGetDb` store. Against a remote database that removed five redundant
  first-connect round trips per process, and it let the pool cap rise so a
  request's concurrent reads no longer serialize behind a single connection.
  Secret reads are now memoized per request, keyed on scope and scope id, so the
  user/org/workspace credential waterfall is not re-walked on every lookup.
  Onboarding step status, resource inheritance layers, and feature-flag rules now
  resolve their independent reads concurrently.
- 89e5910: Give delegated agent turns their app's actions as native tools in dev, so asking
  a sibling app a question actually returns an answer.

  In dev the interactive surface deliberately omits template actions from the tool
  registry and lets the agent reach them through `bash`, which sidesteps the
  degenerate empty-object tool call some models emit for complex schemas. That is
  a reasonable trade for a person, who sees the bad call and rephrases. It is the
  wrong trade for a delegated turn. An A2A caller, or an external host calling
  `ask_app` over MCP, has nobody to intervene: with no native action the receiving
  agent shells out, the call runs long, and the caller records "Interrupted before
  this tool returned a result" — after which callers commonly fall back to
  composing their own queries against a schema they do not own.

  Both delegated surfaces now keep template actions native even in dev. A rejected
  `{}` call returns a schema error the model can correct on its next step, which
  is strictly better than a shell loop no caller can see or recover from.

- 89e5910: Stop paying for background sweeps and no-change polls that find nothing.

  A workspace runs one server per app, so every recurring sweep multiplies by app
  count. Several of them queried unconditionally: the 20-second unclaimed-run
  sweep issued two `agent_runs` scans back to back, the A2A continuation retry ran
  two blind `UPDATE`s before ever checking whether anything was due, the MCP config
  refresh scanned the whole settings table every minute to diff a signature that
  had not moved since boot, and the Google Docs poller re-read its config every 30
  seconds even on deployments where the integration was never enabled. On local
  local database that was free; on a remote or metered database each one is a network round
  trip, forever, per app.

  Each of those now leads with a cheap existence probe or an in-process change
  signal, so the idle case costs one round trip instead of several and the work
  still runs the moment there is any. The poll route gets the same treatment: its
  legacy watermark scan read `application_state` four separate times per check,
  and now reads `MAX(updated_at)` once and only fans out when that advances — a
  cost that repeated per app per connected client.

  Detection latency is unchanged: every probe is a strict superset of the predicate
  it guards, and the negative caches are all narrower than the staleness window
  they sit in front of.

- 89e5910: Cut one database round trip from every authenticated request. The membership
  and `active-org-id` reads behind org resolution now overlap instead of queueing,
  and `resolveOrgIdForEmail` memoizes its `org_members` read per request (keyed on
  the AsyncLocalStorage request context and the email) so credential lookups,
  agent runs, A2A, MCP, and adapter-authenticated action calls — none of which
  carry an h3 event — stop each paying their own lookup.
- 89e5910: Refresh derived database consumers after pool recycling, redact embedded
  credentials from captured tool results, preserve multiline A2A previews, and
  retry MCP configuration refreshes after transient failures.

## 0.131.9

### Patch Changes

- d80a9c9: Report workspace files as truncated only when more content exists beyond the requested read page, and normalize paging arguments to integer boundaries.
- 3c538e4: Preserve application-state database read failures and distinguish explicit stops or exhausted reconnect failures from recoverable chat handoffs.

## 0.131.8

### Patch Changes

- c7ec59d: `create .` now scaffolds into the current directory and takes the project name
  from the folder's basename, matching `create-react-app` / `npm init`. Previously
  `.` was rejected as an invalid name. The current directory must be empty apart
  from benign VCS/editor files (`.git`, `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, …)
  so an existing project is never merged over.

  The scaffold is built in a private staging directory and only the files that
  don't already exist are copied in, so a mid-scaffold failure can never delete
  the current directory (including `.git`) and pre-existing files like
  `README.md` and `.gitignore` are preserved. When the current directory is
  already a git repo, `create .` skips `git init`/commit so it never writes an
  unexpected commit into the user's history.

## 0.131.7

### Patch Changes

- 4f3a651: Harden delegated agent transport and provider selection, and support stable workspace-vault key rotation without changing app-local OAuth encryption.
- 4f3a651: Keep interrupted Plan edits on small targeted writes instead of retrying oversized full-plan payloads.

## 0.131.6

### Patch Changes

- c0e7d64: Clarify workspace `add-app` feedback when no app is selected, and report when every available app is already installed.
- c0e7d64: Give delegated agent turns their app's actions as native tools in dev, so
  asking a sibling app a question actually works.

  In dev the interactive surface deliberately omits template actions from the tool
  registry and lets the agent call them through `bash`, which sidesteps the
  degenerate empty-object tool call some models emit for complex schemas. That
  trade is fine for a person — they see the bad call and rephrase. It is the wrong
  trade for a delegated turn. An A2A caller, or an external host calling `ask_app`
  over MCP, has nobody to intervene: with no native action the receiving agent
  shells out, the call misfires, and it repeats the same command until the
  repetition guard ends the run minutes later with no answer. Observed in a
  workspace as a sibling question that ran 4m45s and returned the wrong window,
  and elsewhere as runs stopped after eight identical `bash` calls.

  Both delegated surfaces now keep template actions native even in dev. A rejected
  `{}` call returns a schema error the model can correct on its next step, which
  is strictly better than a shell loop no caller can see or recover from.

- c0e7d64: Prevent timed Neon queries from leaking statement timeouts across pooled sessions and cancel background HTTP queries at their deadline.
- c0e7d64: Make cross-app delegation ask the receiving specialist agent by default, keep
  typed remote terminal states intact, retry idempotent transient transport
  failures, prevent recursive agent cycles, and bound delegated context growth.
  Proven durable-background delegated runs also keep the full bounded
  continuation allowance while sharing one cumulative wall-clock deadline, so a
  slow successful child task cannot strand its caller before the caller finishes
  its own tool work. After a provider exhausts its short in-call 429/529 retry
  budget, a proven background delegation now gets one cooled-down continuation,
  with a hard cap that prevents sustained throttling from becoming a request
  storm.

  Receiving agents keep ownership of source selection, schema interpretation,
  queries, joins, and their local tools. Direct read actions remain available for
  exact bounded contracts, but are no longer advertised as a workaround for an
  unreliable agent call.

  Dispatch now opts into the same durable background run contract it emits at
  deploy time, so delegated control-plane work is not cut off by the foreground
  40-second budget while already running in the 15-minute worker.

  Workspace vault ciphertext now prefers the workspace A2A-derived encryption
  key over each app's independent auth secret. Existing app-auth-encrypted rows
  remain readable by their owning app and are compare-and-swap migrated on read,
  so sibling agents can reliably resolve the same organization credentials
  without exposing or copying their values. Automatic engine selection also
  pairs the chosen provider with that provider's credential instead of reusing
  an unrelated active key.

  Documentation now distinguishes framework Core, optional Toolkit, and optional
  Templates, and makes source editing an explicit workspace/write-tool capability
  rather than assuming every embedded agent has filesystem access.

- c0e7d64: Retry transient provider TLS connection failures before surfacing them in agent chat.
- c0e7d64: Hide unauthenticated connection tests from MCP presets that require provider setup.
- c0e7d64: Recover background agent turns that stay alive without making real progress, retry transient run-event subscription failures with bounded backoff, keep reconnect diagnostics honest, and deduplicate repeated system prompts in thread debug history.

## 0.131.4

### Patch Changes

- 13f7e6b: Simplify the agent panel's error-recovery copy and move it into the message catalog, so it no longer shows untranslated English or explains the failure as an "internal UI error".

## 0.131.3

### Patch Changes

- 5b67dea: Advertise A2A action input schemas in capability details.
- 5b67dea: Stop apps from handing each other raw queries to execute. An action whose input
  is a program the receiver runs — `sql`, `code`, `script`, `expression` — is no
  longer invocable by a sibling app over A2A.

  The app that owns the data owns its schema, data dictionary, reference
  dashboards, and dialect quirks. A calling app has none of that, so passing SQL
  across apps makes every caller reimplement the owner's schema knowledge from
  guesses, and each copy silently rots the next time the owner's shape changes.
  Callers ask the owning app a question, or call a shaped action that takes
  semantic parameters; the owner forms the query. `publicAgent.allowRawQueryInput`
  opts a specific action out when that is genuinely the right call.

  `query` is deliberately not treated as a raw query field: across the templates
  it is natural-language search text (Brain's `search-everything`,
  `search-knowledge`), and blocking it would break the ask-don't-instruct calls
  this rule exists to encourage. MCP and in-app tool surfaces are unchanged — this
  narrows cross-app invocation only.

  Agent cards also now publish each advertised skill's `inputSchema`, and
  `describe-workspace-apps` renders it as `input: { field*: type }`. Advertising an
  action without its parameters is what led callers to invoke it with `{}` and fail
  on a required field.

## 0.131.2

### Patch Changes

- 8d4fac7: Exclude `.test.ts`/`.spec.ts` files from agent chat plugin action auto-discovery, so test/spec files are no longer registered as callable agent tools.
- 901769d: Keep the session-authenticated remote-device relay routes under CSRF protection.
  The `/integrations/` CSRF exemption exists for HMAC-verified webhooks, but
  prefix matching extended it to `/integrations/remote/*`, where
  `register`, `enqueue`, and `computer/{approvals,commands}` authenticate on the
  `SameSite=None` session cookie. A cross-site simple-request POST could
  therefore create and self-approve a browser-control operation — click, type, or
  navigate on the victim's paired Chrome — without any first-party marker or
  human approval step. Those routes are now excluded from the exemption; the
  device's own bearer-token calls (`poll`, `result`, `heartbeat`) are unaffected.
- 901769d: Keep completed chat history visible when a sidebar remounts.
- 901769d: Keep background and scheduled recovery workers from starting duplicate recurring integration jobs that can exhaust shared database capacity and delay messaging replies.
- 901769d: Keep Feedback visible in first-party Agent-Native production apps even when the build-time feedback URL was not synced, while cloned apps remain opted out by default.
- 901769d: Reuse an empty active chat for foreground requests that otherwise open a new tab.

## 0.131.0

### Minor Changes

- 24a5a20: Make extension creation and discovery opt-in, including authenticated REST
  creation, label SQL-backed extensions as sandboxed custom blocks, and let
  editors promote them into app code through a server-verified Builder handoff.

### Patch Changes

- 24a5a20: Keep scheduled automations classified correctly across scheduler writes, unify Jobs and Automations management, and give Scheduled and Event triggers one identity-checked execution lifecycle with organization scope and enforced MCP allowlists.
- 24a5a20: Preserve source provenance when copying rendered UI between live local apps and Design files.
- 24a5a20: Make generic public URL reads immediately available to agents and preserve
  machine-readable discovery metadata and alternate links when extracting page
  content, including in Plan mode. Large extensions now default to bounded,
  targeted source excerpts so focused edits do not stall a run by loading an
  entire generated app body.
- 24a5a20: Let Plan mode discover every agent tool, execute calls classified as read-only, narrow mixed-tool schemas to safe inputs, and keep writes and unknown effects runtime-blocked.

## 0.130.0

### Minor Changes

- 279e855: Add a first-class CLI flow for installing community-maintained Agent-Native templates from public GitHub repositories, including app selection from community workspace repositories.
- 279e855: Render compact data exports and durable workspace files as private downloads directly in agent chat.
- 279e855: Point org members at their own workspace when they land on a different deployment.

  Orgs can now record a `workspaceUrl` (Settings → Team, owner/admin). Members who
  open a shared hosted app from the template catalog see a notice offering to take
  them to their team's workspace instead of an app that looks empty, and the org
  switcher shows which host they are currently on. Opt-in per org — nothing
  changes for orgs that don't set it, and it offers a choice rather than
  redirecting.

### Patch Changes

- 279e855: Let a browser explicitly sign out of the shared `AUTH_DISABLED` development account so preview users can choose a real account.
- 279e855: Add comment author editing to the Clips template corpus.
- 279e855: Retry transient database locks while a fresh local app initializes during startup.
- 279e855: Prevent frontend action calls from failing with 405 errors when a mutating action declares PUT or DELETE and the caller uses the default mutation transport.
- 279e855: Prevent sketch wireframes from overflowing the browser call stack when layout measurements contain non-finite coordinates.
- 279e855: Fix the chat client telling users "the agent connection kept failing" when a
  turn was actually stopped by `MAX_TOTAL_TRANSIENT_CONTINUATIONS`, the
  whole-turn ceiling on client re-POSTs of `auto_continue`. That cap only ever
  binds turns that were making real progress the whole time, so blaming a
  connection failure named the wrong cause. It now reports its own message:
  the turn hit the limit on how many times it could be automatically
  continued, and suggests retrying as a single, narrower request.
- 279e855: Stop reporting `$ai_generation` token/cost figures as literal `0` when the
  engine never returned a usage report — every run aborted for no-progress
  before any provider response arrived was indistinguishable from a real
  empty-input call, which made it impossible to size the input of failing
  runs. `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `total_tokens`, `cache_read_tokens`,
  `cache_write_tokens`, `cost_cents_x100`, `cost_usd`, and their `$ai_*`
  equivalents are now omitted from the tracking event instead of coerced to
  zero when the engine never reported usage. Also adds `time_to_first_token_ms`,
  measuring elapsed time from run start to the first non-heartbeat engine
  event, omitted (not zeroed) when no such event ever arrived.
- 279e855: Emit an `agent_run_terminal` analytics event for every terminal agent run
  (completed, errored, aborted, or truncated at a continuation boundary),
  reusing the same best-effort `track()` seam that already carries
  `$ai_generation` into `analytics_events`. Run cutoffs — budget exhaustion,
  loop limits, aborts, and the `truncated` continuation status — were
  previously visible only in each app's operational `agent_runs` table and
  absent from analytics entirely. The event carries `run_id`, `thread_id`,
  `turn_id`, `status`, `terminal_reason`, `error_code`, `error_detail`,
  `dispatch_mode`, `abort_reason`, and `duration_ms`; `model`/`engine`/
  `attempt_count` are forwarded through the new optional `StartRunOptions`
  fields, now populated by every built-in `startRun` caller (main chat,
  agent teams, harness runs, integration webhooks, the Google Docs poller,
  and recurring jobs) with the resolved model actually sent to the engine —
  never the raw client-requested one. `userId` is left unset everywhere: no
  caller in this codebase has an opaque (non-email) user id available at its
  `startRun` call site. Emission fires only after the run's terminal status
  and thread_data are durably persisted, and a missing or failing tracking
  provider can never affect the run.
- 279e855: Keep a failed or stopped run visible on the turn it belongs to. The assistant
  turn now carries a collapsed inline marker built from the persisted run-error
  metadata (with the run duration when known), so the failure survives the next
  prompt instead of only existing in the transient recovery banner. The banner
  still owns the run it is showing, so the same failure is never announced twice.
- 279e855: Default MCP connections to personal OAuth, keep personal MCP setup available to organization members, hide unusable organization controls, and honor app preset filters in ejected UIs.
- 279e855: Prevent queued chat prompts from replaying after navigation or remounting the chat.
- 279e855: Recover AI SDK provider network failures after its internal retry wrapper preserves the final transport error.
- 279e855: Fix document bridge injection when page scripts contain closing-tag or dollar-sign literals.
- 279e855: Correct the Dispatch setup docs to match the current workspace picker.
- 279e855: Fix `/_agent-native/open` silently dropping a `Set-Cookie` staged during `getSession()` (e.g. `_session` query-param promotion) when it built a bare 302 `Response`, so an authenticated redirect could still leave the browser signed out. Export `redirectWithStagedCookies` so other routes can reuse the fix.
- 279e855: Add `isLoopbackRequest` to the request context and a `getRequestIsLoopback()` reader. The action-route handler captures the real socket peer (via `getRequestIP` without `x-forwarded-for`, so headers cannot spoof it) while the h3 event is still in scope, letting code below the HTTP layer distinguish a local-dev caller from a remote one. Used by Design to let `/visual-edit` work without a login on a localhost-backed design while keeping remote viewers read-only.

### Patch Changes

- 8c4b44e: Keep the create organization and invite member popovers compact instead of allowing long helper text to expand their width.

## 0.129.0

### Minor Changes

- 0aada94: Serve the stateless MCP 2026-07-28 protocol natively while preserving stateless
  legacy clients, automatically negotiate the newest supported protocol from
  outbound clients and stdio bridges, and harden MCP OAuth issuer, client type,
  scope, credential binding, and Client ID Metadata Document behavior. Require
  durable, single-use MCP 2026 approval elicitation before running actions marked
  `needsApproval`.

  Update the Pinpoint MCP server example to use the stable split MCP v2 packages.

### Patch Changes

- 0aada94: Stop telling sibling agents that an app has no callable actions when it does.
  The public agent card could only advertise actions with `requiresAuth !== true`,
  while `actions/invoke` only ever executes actions with `requiresAuth === true` —
  two disjoint sets. Every app whose A2A actions were authenticated therefore
  published an empty skills list, and `describe-workspace-apps` reported
  "exposes no directly callable actions" about an app the caller could in fact
  call directly. Callers took that at face value and fell back to open-ended
  `call-agent` delegation, which hands schema discovery to a second model; in
  practice that model shelled out through `bash`, failed to find the data, and
  looped until the repetition guard stopped the run.

  The card now serves the invocable set to a caller with a verified A2A identity,
  and sibling capability discovery signs its probe so it sees that set. Anonymous
  card fetches are unchanged and still expose only the publicly-safe list, so no
  capability is disclosed to an unauthenticated reader that was not disclosed
  before.

- 0aada94: Let Design MCP App canvases hand pending visual source edits back to the host coding conversation while preserving the local Design-agent and copy-prompt fallbacks for ordinary browser panes.

  Teach visual-edit users to minimize Design chrome with Figma's `Shift+\` shortcut or the command menu without claiming the host-reserved `Cmd+\` chord.

- 0aada94: Keep client status timeouts isolated to their own endpoint and preserve the last known model readiness when a status probe is temporarily unavailable.
- 0aada94: Visual edit: never render a source snapshot in place of the running app. A localhost screen now always loads a live document — the proxied `/live-edit` frame for viewers holding the connection's `previewToken`, and the plain dev-server URL for everyone else. Previously a viewer without a token (signed-out session, public link, inline browser with no cookies) got the `/snapshot` HTML as `srcdoc`: a frozen copy that looked exactly like the app but had no live DOM behind it, so selection, the layers panel, and edits all silently addressed stale markup.
- 0aada94: Show relative cost per model in the composer's model picker. Each row now
  carries a quiet `$`/`$$`/`$$$` suffix so a user can tell an entry model from a
  flagship one before selecting it, rather than discovering the difference in
  their bill. The tier reuses the token list the picker already sorts by
  (`MODEL_COST_ORDER`) and reflects each provider's own entry/mid/flagship ladder
  — it is not a cross-provider price claim. Models outside that list render with
  no label at all; a guessed tier would read as fact.
- 0aada94: Send `reasoning_effort: "none"` instead of omitting it when a custom OpenAI base
  URL forces Chat Completions with tools present. Omitting the field let OpenAI
  apply the model's own default effort, so GPT-5.6 runs kept failing with
  "Function tools with reasoning_effort are not supported for <model> in
  /v1/chat/completions" even after the field was dropped.
- 0aada94: Use OpenAI's current `gpt-transcribe` model for direct OpenAI voice dictation uploads.
- 0aada94: Refuse to replace symlinked project skill folders during built-in skill installs.
- 0aada94: Queued chat messages now run under the model, engine, and reasoning effort they
  were composed with instead of whatever the picker happens to be set to when the
  queue flushes. Queued bubbles also gain a "Send now" control that interrupts the
  active run, and the pending group is labelled with its count.
- 0aada94: Restore a reachable path for the legacy chat-thread `message_count` repair. Databases predating the column left rows at 0, and both `listThreads` and `searchThreads` filter `message_count > 0` in SQL, so those threads never appeared in the sidebar and nothing called the repair anymore.

  `repairLegacyChatThreadMessageCounts` now runs as a name-tracked migration (`_chat_threads_migrations`) in long-lived app processes, so the `thread_data` scan happens once per database and is skipped entirely on every later boot. Serverless isolates do not launch the repair during cold start; operators can run a long-lived maintenance process against an older hosted database without making concurrent functions race the same full-data scan. `MigrationEntry` gained an optional `run` hook for backfills SQL cannot express; it executes before the bookkeeping row is written, so a failed repair stays unrecorded and retries instead of being marked applied against work that never happened.

- 0aada94: Tell the model the expected parameter signature when a raw-JSON-schema action
  rejects its arguments. Previously only Zod-backed actions echoed the expected
  shape, so a model that guessed a wrong enum or type on a raw-schema action got
  no new information, re-sent the same arguments, and tripped the identical-error
  breaker with the write never executed. The repeated-error stop message is now
  written for the user instead of instructing them to fix the tool arguments.
- 0aada94: Report failed batched schema introspection as an error instead of silently treating the database as up to date.
- 0aada94: Reduce agent-chat startup request fan-out by sharing concurrent status, session, model-discovery, and thread-list reads.
- 0aada94: Stop timed-out Neon database statements on the server instead of only abandoning the client request.
- 0aada94: Stop the chat from claiming a tool is running when nothing is running, and stop
  recording interrupted actions as failures. A tool card only spins while a chat is
  actually running — an activity placeholder alone no longer resurrects a spinner
  on rehydrated history, which is how an email that WAS delivered showed as
  perpetually "sending". When a stream ends with a tool still in flight the card is
  now marked with a distinct unknown outcome ("it may or may not have completed")
  instead of a red failure, both live and in the persisted transcript, because
  "absent" and "unreadable" are not the same answer. The alternate runtime path now
  settles its pending tool calls on `done` and on error like the main SSE path does,
  and a turn whose tool never resolved keeps its "Worked for Xm Ys" summary instead
  of rendering a permanent "Thinking" indicator with nothing behind it.

## 0.128.4

### Patch Changes

- e22b660: Render a best-effort inline chart when an agent emits a hallucinated `/word ... labels=[...] data=[...]` line in chat instead of the documented ```embed fence. Previously that line rendered as inert literal text with no chart. Detection is generic (not tied to any single template's tool name), rejects malformed input (mismatched lengths, negative values, oversized arrays) by falling back to plain text, and correctly skips content inside fenced/indented code blocks.
- f261c10: Warn in the `update-extension` tool description against inlining large static datasets into extension HTML/JS and against oversized single edit/replace payloads, since a payload over roughly 8KB risks the model truncating its own `payloadJson` mid-generation and arriving as an empty or malformed call that stalls the run.

## 0.128.3

### Patch Changes

- 4a59320: Switch the builder-agent-native-starter sync to the vendor-branch model: a new `push-starter-template` workflow materializes the post-processed `templates/chat` and pushes it to the starter's `template` branch (which the starter git-merges into `main`). Removes the obsolete dispatch workflow and the `sync-builder-starter-manifest` CLI (the `merge`/`generate`/`paths` allowlist sync), superseded by `agent-native template materialize` + git-native merge.

- 9140268: Update Builder design-system indexing to call the current `/design-systems/v1/index`
  endpoint with a structured `sources` array (uploaded files, public repos, connected
  projects) instead of the retired `generate` endpoint and its flat `uploads` payload.
  File selections are now attached per source, and the incomplete-response guard only
  requires a `designSystemId`. "Open in Builder" now links into the actual
  project/branch (`branchUrl`) when the service returns one, falling back to the
  design-system-intelligence docs URL. When `/index` returns only a `jobId`, the
  Fusion branch URL is read from `GET /design-systems/v1/decode-jobs/:jobId`
  (exposed as `fetchBuilderDesignSystemDecodeJobStatus`) so "Open in Builder" lands
  on the branch. Large files (notably `.fig`) now stream to
  storage in 16 MiB resumable chunks with retry and offset recovery instead of a
  single unbounded request body. Indexing is split into `startBuilderDesignSystemUpload`
  (opens signed resumable-upload slots) and `indexBuilderDesignSystem` (finalizes from
  resolved sources) so browsers can stream `.fig` bytes straight to storage and never
  hit the serverless request-body cap; `startBuilderDesignSystemIndex` still handles
  small in-memory server-side payloads. Also exports `builderProjectBranchUrl`.

## 0.128.0

### Minor Changes

- ce559da: Add per-app member roles: `defineAppRoles`, an `authorize` gate on `defineAction`, and an `appRoles` column on `TeamPage`.

  Apps that need permissions of their own no longer have to hand-roll a members table or collapse a rich vocabulary into the org's three roles. `defineAppRoles({ appId, roles })` declares an app's role set; `authorize: myApp.requireAny("admin")` gates an action for every caller (agent tool, HTTP, frontend, MCP, A2A, CLI) because it wraps `run` rather than hanging off a flag the dispatchers each have to remember; `<TeamPage appRoles={descriptor} />` adds the assignment column to the existing roster instead of forcing a second members view.

  Org membership stays canonical — an app role only narrows what an existing member may do inside one app. Roles are an unordered set, not a ladder: authorization always names the accepted roles explicitly. `defaultRole` is a display value and never satisfies a guard, membership and assignment resolve in one statement so a stale row cannot authorize, and a failed lookup throws rather than resolving to a deny-shaped status.

### Patch Changes

- ce559da: Keep serverless startup bounded by moving legacy chat-thread repair, global stale-run cleanup, and remote MCP connection setup out of route initialization, and batch additive Postgres schema introspection into one query.
- ce559da: Keep the hidden-mode agent sidebar on chat when restoring persisted panel state.
- ce559da: Fix browser live transcription silently freezing mid-recording. `useLiveTranscription` now restarts recognition off the event loop instead of synchronously inside `onend` (Chrome throws `InvalidStateError` there), retries a failed restart with backoff instead of giving up after one throw, and exposes `getIncompleteReason()` so callers can tell a partial capture from a finished one.
- ce559da: Make two first-run failures explain themselves instead of looking like a broken app.

  The full-screen loading shell now reveals an explanatory line after 10 seconds
  ("a first run compiles dependencies…, otherwise check the terminal"). The reveal
  is a pure-CSS `animation-delay`, not a timer, because the states that strand a
  user on this screen — hydration never running, a route module 404ing, a cold dev
  compile — are exactly the states where none of our JS executes. A featureless
  spinner is indistinguishable from a blank page and reads as "the app is broken"
  rather than "look at the terminal".

  Missing-table database errors now name the likely cause. The driver reports
  `relation "x" does not exist` from whichever query touched it first, so the stack lands in
  an action and reads as a bug there; the real cause is almost always that no
  migration created it, which is what a template with no `server/plugins/db.ts`
  does. The hint is appended to the driver's original message, so existing error
  classifiers that match its substrings are unaffected.

- ce559da: Stop refusing real deck URLs in A2A responses. The artifact guard only accepted
  decks from `create-deck`, `duplicate-deck`, `get-deck`, `list-decks`, and
  `add-slide`, and rejected a `create-deck` that saved an empty deck — so the
  documented "create empty, then fill" flow, `patch-deck`, `save-deck`,
  `update-slide`, `import-pptx`, and `restore-deck-version` all produced "I could
  not verify the deck URL" for decks that were genuinely saved. Any successful
  result that names a deck (an explicit `deckId`, or a canonical `/deck/<id>` URL
  the action itself returned) now verifies it.
- ce559da: Fix the cold-start failure mode that turns a serverless page load into a burst of 502/504s, and stop the chat spinner from hanging forever when the run-status probe is unreachable.

  **Container-killing 502.** `createCoreRoutesPlugin` rethrew after `rejectInit(error)`.
  Nitro invokes plugins as `try { plugin(app) } catch`, which cannot catch an async
  rejection, so that rethrow surfaced as an `unhandledRejection`: Node exits, the
  serverless container dies, and every in-flight request on it returns a bare 502.
  `rejectInit` already routes the failure to the readiness gate's retryable 503, so
  the rethrow only destroyed the container.

  **Unbounded readiness gate.** Requests to `/_agent-native/*` waited on plugin
  bootstrap with no deadline, so a slow cold boot parked them until the platform
  killed the invocation — the client got nothing it could act on. The gate now
  releases after `AGENT_NATIVE_ROUTE_READY_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 25s, deliberately
  below the shortest deployment target's request wall) and answers with a retryable
  503 instead.

  **155MB function bundles.** Serverless builds copied every platform variant of
  legacy database addons and `@resvg` into the output — darwin, win32, android and 32-bit arm
  binaries a Lambda can never execute, ~66MB of dead weight, paid again for each
  additional emitted function. Cold start scales with bundle size, and a page that
  opens several requests at once scales out to that many cold containers, which is
  why this surfaced as 502/504 on a page's first burst rather than as a slow deploy.

  **Eternal "Thinking…".** `AssistantChat` treated a failed `/runs/active` probe as
  "no active run" and returned early. That probe is the only path that clears the
  stored active run and no caller reschedules it, so a transient 5xx left the
  spinner up permanently — surviving reloads, because the stored run lives in
  `sessionStorage`. It now retries, then clears the stored run and raises a
  recoverable `run_status_unavailable` error. `activeRunLooksStale` also falls back
  to the heartbeat when a run was killed before recording any progress, so those
  runs no longer read as perpetually fresh.

  **Dead tools advertised in production.** `source-search` was registered for the
  production agent even where its corpus is not deployed, so its only possible
  answer was "not found". It is now registered only when the corpus exists, and
  `docs-search` says when framework doc pages are absent from the deployment
  instead of letting a miss read as "that page does not exist".

- ce559da: Teach visual-edit to open Design in supported inline browser panes and document multi-page, flow, state, and responsive canvas reviews.

## 0.127.3

### Patch Changes

- 750e90e: Add a `materialize --out <dir>` subcommand to `agent-native template` that writes the post-processed standalone template tree (e.g. `--template chat`, with the template's own identity, `_gitignore`→`.gitignore`, resolved deps, standalone `netlify.toml`) to a directory — no existing app required. This is the monorepo half of the vendor-branch starter mirror: the public monorepo materializes `templates/chat` and pushes it to the private starter's `template` branch, which the starter merges into `main` with git. Reuses the existing `materializeTemplate` engine.

## 0.127.2

### Patch Changes

- c6ca76a: Fix the Builder Design Systems API base URL fallback incorrectly including an `agent-native/` prefix. The real route is registered as `/design-systems/v1/...` with no `agent-native/` prefix, so requests using the fallback base URL (when `BUILDER_DESIGN_SYSTEMS_BASE_URL` is unset) were hitting the wrong path.

## 0.127.1

### Patch Changes

- bbd202b: Fix the model picker offering a model the app cannot route, and the chat bridge dropping submitted model overrides.
  - The picker now defaults only to a configured engine group, and shows nothing when none is configured. `DEFAULT_MODEL` is a builder-gateway id that no group carries unless Builder is connected, so the old `?? DEFAULT_MODEL` / `?? groups[0]` fallbacks produced a selection the server silently replaced with its own default.
  - A submitted `model`/`engine` pair is now applied regardless of whether the engine list has loaded, travels with cold-start queued sends, keeps the sender's engine, and treats a blank engine as absent. Previously it was honored only when the model already appeared in the (initially empty) engine list, so app-initiated first turns lost it.
  - `[agent-chat] resolved …` now logs `requestModel` and `turnId`, making a server-side model substitution visible.

## 0.127.0

### Minor Changes

- cbc6936: Make connecting one agent-native app to another a guided flow instead of three
  blank text fields.
  - New `GET /_agent-native/agents/probe` reads a peer's agent card and makes one
    authenticated no-op call, reporting `reachable` and `authorized` as
    independent fields. A peer that answers but rejects the caller's token is the
    failure local dev hides — the receiver runs unauthenticated on localhost, so a
    mismatched secret previously surfaced only after deploy.
  - Settings → Manage agent → Connected Agents is URL-first: paste a peer URL,
    press Check, and the name and description come from its card. Unreachable
    never blocks the save. Rows carry a liveness dot from one batched probe.
  - The section now shows shared-secret state and a Sync to apps action inline,
    reusing the existing org hooks. A caller who cannot see the secret is told so
    rather than being shown "not set".
  - After an add, the UI states that registration is one-directional and deep
    links to the peer's own settings with the values prefilled.
  - The Connected Agents list collapses a remote agent that still has its
    pre-migration `agents/*.json` row alongside the canonical
    `remote-agents/*.json` one, instead of listing it twice with the same URL.
  - `list-connected-agents` keys custom manifests by the normalized agent id, so
    an agent registered as `images`/`asset` no longer appears once as a discovered
    agent and again as a custom one.
  - Export `resolveA2ACallerAuth` from `@agent-native/core/a2a` so app code can
    authenticate outbound A2A calls without reimplementing org-secret lookup.
  - The `a2a-protocol` skill documents the real setup path — A2A is auto-mounted,
    peers are `remote-agents/*.json` resources, and auth is a JWT signed with
    `A2A_SECRET` or the per-org secret — replacing the `mountA2A` + per-peer
    `apiKeyEnv` flow the framework no longer wires up.

### Patch Changes

- f8df095: Keep cross-app `ask_app_status` polling attached to the original task route with an encrypted task handle, report the configured app identity in standalone MCP discovery, and reject unknown cross-app targets instead of running them locally.
- cbc6936: Hide pending workspace apps by default and expose app ownership metadata from each card's overflow menu.
- cbc6936: Show the provider's brand logo on agent tool rows for catalog-backed MCP tools, instead of a generic code icon.
- cbc6936: Settings → Connections: the "New" key menu is now a searchable, scrolling combobox instead of a cropped dropdown, so every registered key is reachable.
- cbc6936: Send `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` on CDN-served static assets.

  `/assets/**`, `/favicon.*`, `/manifest.json`, `/icon-*.svg`, and
  `/library-presets/**` are served straight off the CDN, so the security-headers
  h3 middleware never runs for them and they shipped without the `nosniff` header
  that every function-served response already carries.

- cbc6936: Make the chat Stop button actually stop the turn.

  A turn runs as a chain of runs: every `loop_limit` / `auto_continue` boundary
  and every background handoff starts a successor under a new run id but the same
  turn id. Stop only aborted the run id the client happened to hold, so the
  successor claimed itself and the agent kept looping — the turn-abort marker that
  `isTurnAborted` consults was only ever written on the pre-run path, which is
  dead as soon as a run id exists.

  `POST /runs/:id/abort` now escalates user-intent reasons (`user`, `abort`,
  `user_stuck_cancel`, `user_stuck_retry`) to a turn-wide abort. Watchdog reasons
  (`no_progress`, `auto_stuck_retry`) keep single-run semantics so they cannot
  kill a server-side continuation chain that is still making progress.

## 0.126.0

### Minor Changes

- b99b899: **Breaking:** rename the `registerShareableResource` resolver `getShareEmailLogoUrl` (added in 0.125.0) to `getLogoUrl`. Update any registration that used the old name.

  Add `getBrandName`, `getSender`, and `getHeroHtml` resolvers to `registerShareableResource`, plus an optional `heroHtml` on `renderEmail` and `fromName` on `sendEmail`. Share-notification emails can now render a template-owned preview block above the CTA (injected verbatim, so a template supplies its own markup — e.g. a video thumbnail with a play badge), override the brand name shown beside the logo, and appear to come from the sharing user ("Alice via Clips") with replies routed to them while keeping the configured domain-verified sending address so SPF/DKIM still pass.

## 0.125.0

### Minor Changes

- c7ed52a: Add an optional `brandLogoUrl` to `renderEmail` and a `getShareEmailLogoUrl` resolver on `registerShareableResource`, so share-notification emails show the sharing org's logo (absolute `https://`) when available and fall back to the embedded Agent-Native logo otherwise.

### Patch Changes

- fc5f2db: Extract picture shape size and slide dimensions when parsing PPTX files, so importers can tell a full-bleed cover photo from a small inset image and preserve each image's real aspect ratio.

## 0.124.4

### Patch Changes

- c849ba0: Recover clicked routes in the desktop app when a stale lazy route chunk is encountered.
- c849ba0: Label final-response-guard corrective retries as framework directives. They are
  appended as user-role messages, so an unlabeled one reads like an injected user
  turn — models were refusing them out loud to the real user ("this message looks
  like a prompt injection attempt") instead of revising the draft.

## 0.124.3

### Patch Changes

- c385fed: Keep emoji and other multi-code-point grapheme clusters intact while streaming text. The incremental segmentation cache re-segmented from a fixed character offset, so a cluster straddling that offset was cut in half and characters were silently dropped from the smoothed output. The re-segmentation window now starts on a grapheme boundary.

## 0.124.2

### Patch Changes

- 7568c67: Fix system email sending failing on serverless (ENOENT reading the branding
  favicon). The inline email logo is now bundled as a base64 TS module instead of
  read from disk at send time, so verification/invite/reset emails work in
  production where raw assets aren't traced into the deploy bundle.

## 0.124.1

### Patch Changes

- 661ee71: Register the CRM template in the CLI template catalog.

  `crm` is added to `TEMPLATES` as a **hidden** entry (dev port 8107,
  `defaultMode: "dev"`), so `agent-native new` can scaffold it by name while it
  stays out of the public catalog until it is explicitly unhidden. The mirrored
  list in `@agent-native/shared-app-config` is updated to match.

  Two cross-template specs are widened to cover it: the UI-primitives sync check
  now includes `crm`, and the page-chat handoff check reads CRM's layout from
  `app/components/layout/CrmLayout.tsx` and expects `requireActiveHandoff: false`,
  since CRM's full-page chat lives on its own `/ask` route.

## 0.124.0

### Minor Changes

- e9dd025: `agent-native dev --inspect` (and `--inspect-brk`, optionally `=<port>`) now
  attaches the Node inspector to **only** the Nitro API-server process, on a
  single known port (default 9229). It selects Nitro's `node-process` dev runner
  so the server is a real, attachable process, and injects `NODE_OPTIONS` through
  a Vite preload that runs before Vite's own startup — so Vite, pnpm, and the CLI
  are never inspected and there is exactly one debugger target. Set
  `NITRO_DEV_RUNNER` yourself to override the runner.

## 0.123.2

### Patch Changes

## 0.123.0

### Minor Changes

- 52cce19: One sign-in journey: collapse five return-path validators, four "don't redirect
  to yourself" checks, and two login documents into a single primitive

  `@agent-native/core/shared` now exports `signInJourney`, `normalizeAppPath`,
  `encodeContinuation`, and `decodeContinuation`. Every sign-in surface — the
  client gate, the login document, and the `/_agent-native/sign-in` entry route —
  computes its destination through that one function. The sign-in URL carries an
  opaque `?c=` continuation holding a PATH instead of a re-encoded URL, so a
  return target cannot nest inside another one and the anti-loop checks are
  deleted rather than centralised.

  Fixed by this change:
  - **Google-only apps looped on sign-in.** `createGoogleAuthPlugin` shipped its
    own login page whose completion was `window.location.href = ret || '/'` with
    `ret` set to the sign-in page itself — sign in, land back on sign-in. That
    page is gone; the plugin now serves `getOnboardingHtml({ googleOnly: true })`,
    gaining the already-signed-in bounce, stuck-button recovery, and i18n.
    `createGoogleAuthPlugin`'s signature is unchanged, but the markup is
    different: the Google button/error/debug element ids are now `google-btn`,
    `google-err`, `google-debug` (previously `btn`, `err`, `debug`).
  - **Base-path deploys bounced forever.** `/myapp/login` was not recognised as an
    auth entry path, so a signed-in visitor resumed to the login page.
  - **Verification emails linked back to a login form**, because the `callbackURL`
    posted to Better Auth could legitimately be the sign-in page.
  - **Embed tickets minted for an auth entry path** were honoured; they now fail
    closed on the existing "Invalid embed target." 400.
  - **Open redirect**: continuations are validated on both encode and decode, and
    must be contained in the app's own base path — a sibling app's path on a
    multi-app workspace host is rejected.

  Scope: this fixes _where you land_, not _whether the cookie arrived_. The
  Builder iframe, Builder desktop proxy, and Agent-Native Desktop surfaces fail
  for cookie-delivery reasons; the `_session` URL bridge and
  `appendSessionToOAuthReturnUrl` are deliberately untouched. Those surfaces will
  now land on the right page logged out rather than bouncing to a login loop.

  Compatibility:
  - `/_agent-native/sign-in?return=<path>` is accepted **permanently**. Generated
    apps hand-write it and cannot be upgraded. New producers must emit `?c=`.
  - `buildSignInReturnHref()` keeps its zero-arg call signature and gains an
    optional `{ returnTo }`. It now emits `?c=`.
  - `safeReturnPath()` keeps its signature, `"/"` fallback, and rejections; it is
    now a deprecated one-line delegate to `normalizeAppPath` and deliberately
    applies no base-path containment, because its eight remaining call sites are
    provider OAuth returns rather than sign-in journeys.
  - `isOnSignInPage()` is removed. It was never reachable through a package export
    and has no remaining callers.

- 52cce19: Stop sending the organization A2A secret in `GET /_agent-native/org/me`. That
  route runs on every page load, so the secret that signs first-party A2A/MCP
  JWTs was sitting in JSON any script on the page could read. `/org/me` now
  returns only `a2aSecretSet: boolean` for owners/admins, and the value is
  fetched on demand from the new owner/admin `GET /_agent-native/org/a2a-secret`
  (`useRevealA2ASecret()`) when an operator reveals or copies it. Apps that read
  `OrgInfo.a2aSecret` should switch to `a2aSecretSet` plus `useRevealA2ASecret()`.
  Deployments whose secret was previously exposed should rotate it from the Team
  page (Regenerate then Sync to apps).
- 52cce19: Export `OG_FONT_FAMILY` from `@agent-native/core/server` alongside `resolveOgFontFiles`. Server-side SVG rasterization needs the family name and the bundled font files to agree — serverless runtimes have no system fonts, so a mismatch renders every `<text>` blank. Callers previously had to hardcode the family name to keep it in sync.

### Patch Changes

- 52cce19: Stop action queries from spinning forever, and stop the sync loop from replaying
  dead requests. The action fetch timeout now rejects the caller directly instead
  of relying on `AbortController`, so a transport that ignores the abort signal (a
  patched fetch, a wedged service worker, a body stream that never ends) surfaces a
  typed 408 the UI can render and retry rather than an eternal loading skeleton.
  `useDbSync` no longer refetches an action query whose last fetch failed with
  401/403 — those repeat identically until the session changes, and one expired
  session was reissuing them on every SSE/poll tick.
- 52cce19: Every `active-org-id` write now goes through `setActiveOrgId(email, orgId, reason)`,
  which logs a loud warning when it moves an account from one organization to
  another.

  Vault credentials are scoped per organization, so repointing an account orphans
  every key synced under the previous org — and the only symptom is a
  missing-credential error naming the key, which sends everyone looking for a
  deployment or env-var problem. The existing notices
  (`org.createOrgVaultNotice`, `org.acceptInvitationOrgSwitchNotice`) only reach a
  human looking at the screen, and `createOrganization()` only warned about the
  account that created the org. A roster or identity migration run by an agent
  repointed members through `putUserSetting` directly, with nothing anywhere in
  its path saying an org boundary had moved.

  The warning names both organizations, the reason for the write, and the
  orphaned-credential consequence. An unreadable previous org is reported
  distinctly from an absent one, so a silent repoint cannot look like a
  first-time assignment in the log.

- 52cce19: Make the `/_agent-native/agent-engine/status` probe cheap. The route ran four sequential DB/secret hops per request (session, org, `OPENAI_BASE_URL` secret, `agent-engine` setting) plus an unconditional `app_secrets` sweep, which is why the agent panel took seconds to decide whether a provider is configured. The stored-setting and base-URL reads now run concurrently, the `app_secrets` sweep only runs when the cheaper sources have not answered, and concurrent probes of the same user/org share one in-flight lookup. The shared entry is dropped as soon as the lookup settles, so adding or removing a provider is never reported stale and no identity ever sees another's answer.
- 52cce19: Bound what a single agent turn can spend, and stop paying for the same work twice.
  - The configured iteration budget is now a real cap: the loop stops at a terminal
    `loop_limit` instead of nudging itself and resetting the counter, so the event
    the run manager, thread builder and client all already handled finally reaches
    them.
  - New per-turn input-token ceiling (`AGENT_MAX_RUN_INPUT_TOKENS`, default 3M)
    that rides the continuation body, so chained chunks share one allowance rather
    than getting a fresh one each.
  - A chained chunk now serves a read-only tool's journaled result from an earlier
    chunk of the same turn instead of re-running it, respecting `dedupe: false`
    and same-turn write invalidation.
  - Turns are bounded by a 20-minute wall clock in addition to the run-count
    ledger, and both exhaustion paths end with a summary of what actually
    completed instead of a bare reason string.
  - Token usage rows now carry run, thread and turn ids so spend is attributable.
  - Anthropic-shaped engines split the system prompt at a stable/volatile boundary
    and cache the stable prefix for an hour, so mid-turn resource churn no longer
    invalidates the system prompt and tool schemas together.
  - A failed continuation dispatch consults the successor's claim on every target,
    so a lost response no longer reports a handoff that actually landed.
  - Per-tool timeouts are clamped to what can fire inside the run's own chunk
    budget.
  - Builds that opt into durable background now fail loudly when the function
    cannot be emitted, assert the artifact on disk, keep the background Lambda
    warm, and report once per isolate when the deployed function is unreachable.
  - Terminal run outcomes are rolled up into daily counters before pruning, so
    completion rates survive the asymmetric retention windows; a worker that dies
    mid-tool is now reaped in ~2 minutes instead of ~14.5.

- 52cce19: Risky operations now warn the agent in the conversation instead of only the
  server console. A new `warnAgent()` channel lets a helper deep inside an action's
  call stack — `setActiveOrgId`, `createOrganization` — raise a warning without
  access to the action's `ctx`; the agent loop drains it after the tool call and
  appends tagged `<agent-warning>` blocks to that tool's result, so it reaches the
  model's context, the transcript, and the ledger in one write. A framework core
  prompt rule requires the agent to relay a critical warning to the user before
  reporting success. Outside an agent run (CLI, migration script, boot) warnings
  still go to the console. Also fixes `createOrganization` silently treating an
  unreadable membership probe as "this account had no other organization".
- 52cce19: Bound runaway agent turns by repetition rather than by volume, so genuinely deep
  analyses are no longer cut off.

  The turn budgets introduced alongside the terminal iteration cap were sized as
  work limits rather than runaway backstops, which would have stopped legitimate
  long-running work: production contains a real 117-tool-call analysis that a
  100-iteration cap would have truncated, and a multi-source investigation can
  legitimately exceed both a 20-minute wall clock and a 3M-token ceiling.

  Volume does not distinguish a spiral from depth. Repetition does — the observed
  runaway turns issued 39 identical `run-code` webFetches and 43 identical
  `docs-search` calls, while the expensive-but-healthy turns kept making _new_
  calls. So the ceilings move up to backstop levels (400 iterations, 20M input
  tokens, 90 minutes) and a new per-turn guard stops a turn once the same tool has
  been called with identical arguments `MAX_IDENTICAL_TOOL_CALLS` (8) times,
  counted before any journal or cache short-circuit — serving a repeat from cache
  still means the model is asking the same question again.

- 52cce19: Stop the chat client from competing with the server's run recovery. The browser
  no-progress watchdog now sits above the server's authoritative backstop,
  suspends while a tool call or A2A delegation is open, and reattaches to the run
  instead of aborting it. Background follow gained per-turn run/time budgets so a
  redispatch loop can no longer spin indefinitely, empty continuations back off
  exponentially, a trailing `clear` event can no longer wipe a rebuilt transcript,
  and the "agent stopped without sending a final message" notice is suppressed
  while the server still reports the run as running.
- 52cce19: Stop the agent composer from locking into a silently dead state. An
  engine-readiness check that timed out or failed is now kept distinct from a
  confirmed "no provider configured": it leaves the composer usable instead of
  disabling it, and retries on a backoff instead of latching until reload. The
  2.5s client budget that a single warm-server status probe routinely lost is
  now a 15s abort ceiling rather than a deadline the probes race. A composer is
  only ever disabled when the "Connect AI" affordance renders alongside it.
- 52cce19: Load `describe-workspace-apps` and `call-agent` on the first model request. The
  `<available-apps>` prompt block names both tools by name, but the lazy initial
  tool surface omitted their schemas, so an agent asked "which app should I use
  for this?" answered from assumption instead of reading its peers' live agent
  cards.
- 52cce19: Owners can now delete an organization from Settings → Organization, and portaled
  menus no longer render behind raised app surfaces.
  - New owner-only `DELETE /_agent-native/org` (type-to-confirm in the UI) removes
    the org's invitations, org-scoped settings, members, and the org row, then
    repoints the caller's active org to another membership or Personal.
  - `@agent-native/core/styles/agent-native.css` now imports the toolkit
    stylesheet. Core's own client components render toolkit UI, so apps that
    didn't import `@agent-native/toolkit/styles.css` themselves never generated
    the classes that only appear inside toolkit components — including the
    `z-[290]` on dropdown/select/popover content, which made those menus open
    behind the app shell.

- 52cce19: Fix the design-connect bridge proxy corrupting Vite query-suffixed module responses, which broke hydration in visual-edit iframes.
- 52cce19: `design connect --daemon` now writes the detached bridge's output to
  `.agent-native/design-connect.log` and prints that path. Previously the daemon
  ran with stdio ignored, so a bridge that crashed or lost its port left no trace
  and Design silently fell back to non-editable iframes.
- 52cce19: Fix two independent defects behind intermittent `Missing <KEY>` errors for
  multi-org users.

  Membership resolution now asks the database for a deterministic order
  (`ORDER BY joined_at ASC, org_id ASC`), so the oldest membership wins. The three
  fallback paths in `org/context.ts` — `getOrgContext`, `resolveOrgIdForEmail`, and
  `resolveOrgIdForEmailViaEvent` — previously read the first row of an unordered
  `SELECT`. On Postgres that order is a query-plan and physical-layout detail, so
  any multi-org user without a valid persisted `active-org-id` got an arbitrary
  answer that could change between two identical requests, and `getSession` then
  froze it into `session.orgId`. This does not repair users who already have the
  wrong org persisted in `active-org-id`; that needs a separate data change.

  `syncGrantsToApp` now writes each vault secret under the org that owns the row
  instead of the org of whoever clicked Sync. In `all-apps` mode it lists secrets
  across every org the caller can see, then synced them all with the caller's ctx,
  which `credentialStoreScopeForVaultCtx` turned into `scope: "org"` +
  `scopeId: <caller org>`. Because `writeAppSecret` upserts, that copied rather
  than moved, so credential material accumulated in whichever orgs happened to be
  active during a sync. Grouping by the row's own tenant matches what every other
  sync path already did via `ctxForSecretRow`. The sync result and audit entry now
  report `credentialStores` (one entry per tenant written) in place of the single
  `credentialStore` object.

- 52cce19: Remove the unreferenced `agentPanel.connectionUnavailable` localization string. The composer no longer has a click-to-retry dead state, so nothing rendered it.
- 52cce19: Shrink what the framework installs and carries by removing code and dependencies
  nothing could reach. No public entry point exported any of it, so the package's
  export surface is unchanged.
  - Dropped the `@floating-ui/dom` dependency, which has no reference in
    `packages/core` or `packages/toolkit`; positioning goes through the Radix
    primitives that already declare their own copy.
  - Dropped the `@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-base` dependency.
    `observability/tracing.ts` documents that heavy `@opentelemetry/sdk-*`
    packages are deliberately kept out of the dependency list and resolves
    `@opentelemetry/api` as an optional dependency at runtime, so this entry
    contradicted the module it was added for.
  - Deleted `client/extensions/agent-native-extension-runtime.ts`, the orphaned
    predecessor of `portable-extension`, which every live importer already used.
  - Deleted the unreferenced `BackgroundAgentSection`, `BrowserSection`, and
    `MissingKeyCard` components, plus the dead `DemoModeIcon` and
    `VoiceTranscriptionIcon` helpers.

- 52cce19: Stop deploys from silently losing the durable-background Netlify function. An
  opted-in build now fails instead of warning when the function cannot be emitted,
  asserts the artifact actually landed where Netlify scans for it, and the runtime
  reports once per isolate when a worker that expected the background function is
  running on the synchronous function instead. The keep-warm scheduled function
  also pings the background function so it stops cold-starting on every dispatch,
  and the workspace deploy gate now shares the runtime flag parse instead of
  keeping a third, inverted copy.
- 52cce19: Make agent engine failures diagnosable and recoverable: record the `cause`
  chain behind a bare "Connection error." / "fetch failed" instead of dropping
  it, stop the Anthropic and AI SDK retry layers from multiplying the loop's own
  retries, stop retrying once the next backoff would not fit the remaining run
  budget, resume a resumable transport error in-process on the foreground while
  budget remains, and stop letting a gateway keepalive release the 25s
  first-model-event cap.
- 52cce19: Engine adapters no longer drop a tool call whose arguments were split across
  stream deltas. Every adapter now accumulates the streamed argument JSON and
  reconciles it against what the turn actually delivered: a call assembled from
  its deltas is executed normally, and one whose stream was cut mid-arguments
  becomes an in-band tool-call error the model reads and retries from, instead of
  ending the turn advertising an action that never ran ("The agent stopped before
  starting the X action").
- 52cce19: Give headless agent runs the same recovery the chat surface has, and keep a
  deliberate stop from being auto-restarted. Scheduled jobs, automation triggers,
  messaging-integration turns, and Google Docs comment replies now run through the
  resume wrapper instead of calling the agent loop raw, so a transport-level cut
  (gateway timeout, socket hang up, upstream 5xx) is resumed inside the same
  invocation rather than silently losing the run. Job runs are marked as
  background dispatch so the stale reaper stops reaping them mid-flight against a
  window sized for a browser-streamed foreground run, and a job that ended at a
  continuation boundary is recorded as an error instead of shipping its truncated
  partial answer as a success. Recovery aborts that are neither a user stop nor a
  continuation boundary (a Slack cancel, a stuck-banner auto-retry) now surface
  their real reason without the client auto-continuing the work someone just
  stopped.
- 52cce19: Warn before accepting an org invitation silently repoints your credentials.
  Accepting force-sets the active org, and because vault keys are per-org, a user
  who joins a second org can find apps that worked yesterday reporting a saved key
  as missing — with nothing in the flow having said an org boundary existed. The
  org switcher's invitation rows now carry one inline line naming the consequence:
  connected apps will switch to the new organization's vault keys.

  Shown only when the user already has an active org. The no-active-org gate
  (`RequireActiveOrg`) reaches the same accept action, but a user with no current
  org has no credentials to be moved away from, so the line would be noise there.

- 52cce19: Integrations panel: stop offering a local-only webhook URL as if it will work.

  Slack, WhatsApp, and Telegram verify a webhook Request URL by calling it from
  their own infrastructure, so the loopback URL a local dev server produces
  (`http://127.0.0.1:8101/...`) can never pass verification. The webhook slot now
  detects non-public URLs — loopback, `0.0.0.0`, `::1`, `*.local`, private LAN
  ranges, and any plain-`http:` origin — and swaps the copyable URL for a short
  explanation: deploy the app, or expose the server through an HTTPS tunnel, then
  reopen the page from the public address. Publicly reachable URLs are unchanged.

- 52cce19: Fix mounted-app API thumbnails/media 404ing in dev when a template is mounted
  under a base path (e.g. `/assets`, `/clips`) as part of a unified workspace
  deploy. Browsers send `Sec-Fetch-Dest: image/video/audio/track` for
  `<img>`/`<video>`/`<audio>` fetches, not `empty`, so the dev-server base-strip
  guard only stripped the mount prefix off document/iframe/frame/empty
  requests, leaving media API calls with the prefix still attached and the
  request fell through to a generic "Cannot GET" 404 instead of reaching the
  app's real handler. The guard now strips the mount prefix for image, video,
  audio, and track requests too — this only ever affects `/api/**` paths, so
  static asset and module requests mounted under the base are unaffected.
- 52cce19: Write NUL group-key delimiters as `\u0000` escapes instead of raw NUL bytes so
  these files stay searchable. Ripgrep's binary-content heuristic treats any file
  containing a `\0` byte as binary and prints only a `binary file matches` notice
  with no lines, so `poll.ts`, `app-skill.ts`, `session-replay.ts`, and
  `app-creation-store.ts` were invisible to every ripgrep-backed search — agents
  and humans grepping them for a symbol got zero results and concluded it did not
  exist. The escape sequence is the same character at runtime; only the on-disk
  byte the heuristic keys on changes, so there is no behavior change.
- 52cce19: `/_agent-native/open` validates its redirect target with the shared sign-in
  primitive

  `safeRelativePath` in the deep-link route was the last surviving return-path
  validator outside `normalizeAppPath`, and the weakest: prefix checks only, with
  no WHATWG reparse and no auth-entry rejection. It now delegates, so
  `?to=/_agent-native/sign-in` falls back to the app home instead of deep-linking
  a visitor at a login form, and anything the URL parser normalises past `//` is
  rejected rather than passed through. No base-path containment is applied here —
  the base is added afterwards by `withConfiguredRedirectBasePath`, so the value
  is still base-relative at validation time.

  Deprecation shims left in place by the sign-in unification, for the record:
  - `safeReturnPath()` (`@agent-native/core/server`) — `@deprecated`, a one-line
    delegate to `normalizeAppPath`, kept for eight provider-OAuth call sites.
  - `/_agent-native/sign-in?return=<path>` — not deprecated and never removable.
    Generated apps in the wild hand-write it. Only new producers are forbidden
    (`guard:one-sign-in`); the consumer is permanent API surface.

- 52cce19: Say at org-creation time that vault keys are not shared between organizations.
  The three surfaces that call `createOrgHandler` — the org switcher's create
  form, the Team page's create card, and the "create a separate organization"
  branch of the no-org gate — now carry one inline line stating that a new
  organization starts with an empty vault and needs its own API keys.

  The boundary itself is unchanged; only its visibility is. `app_secrets` has no
  scope readable by every org (a `workspace` row's `scope_id` is always an org id
  or `solo:<email>`, and `readAppSecret` is strict equality), while the vault UI
  advertises keys as "available to every workspace app". Users were therefore
  discovering the per-org boundary weeks later as a missing key on a page that had
  always worked, rather than at the moment they chose to create the org.

  The no-org gate shows the line only when the user had an organization available
  to join, since the first organization in a workspace has nothing to diverge from.

- 52cce19: Make the Personal/Workspace secret scope consequence visible before it bites.

  The scope picker in Settings → API Keys & Connections now carries inline
  helper text explaining that a Personal key is only used by that person's own
  signed-in sessions, and that integration, webhook, scheduled job, automation,
  and agent-to-agent runs sign in as their owner and cannot read it.

  When the trap is hit anyway, the provider API "credential not configured"
  error now explains it: if a key of that name is saved in the caller's own
  organization under Personal scope, the error names the scope it was found in
  and the scope the run needed. The probe is bounded to the caller's own org and
  reports only the scope kind — never the value, the owning account, or anything
  about another tenant.

- 52cce19: Keep credentials saved before an organization existed reachable afterwards.
  A key saved while a user had no org is stored at `workspace` scope under
  `solo:<email>`. Once that user joined or created an org, the generic lookups
  stopped at org scope, so the key was still in the vault but the app reported it
  as not configured. `resolveCredential` and `resolveSecret` now probe the solo
  workspace scope as the final step, matching what the Builder credential paths
  already did.

  The probe is last on purpose: user scope, org scope, the org's workspace row,
  and the org-scoped legacy setting are all tried first, so a current org-scoped
  key always wins over a stale pre-org one. It also stays behind the existing
  store-readability check — a failed org-scoped read is still reported as
  retryable rather than being answered from the pre-org row.

- 52cce19: Stop the compact startup-context budget from silently dropping required prompt
  sections. `selectPromptSectionsWithinBudget` was greedy-with-skip over an
  untyped `string[]`, so an app with large instruction files could exhaust the
  48,000-character budget and lose the last section in the array — usually
  `<available-apps>`, the only place the prompt says which peer apps exist. The
  agent then reported cross-app work as impossible with no trace anywhere.

  Sections now carry the `ContextGovernanceTier` the context manifest already
  reports for them, and `required` sections (workspace-core `AGENTS.md`, the
  on-demand context note, and `<available-apps>`) are reserved before
  discretionary sections compete for the remainder. Omissions are logged with
  each section's label and size, and the `<context-budget-note>` now names what
  was dropped so the agent knows to re-read rather than assume absence. If
  required sections alone exceed the budget they are sent whole and over budget —
  a truncated list of workspace apps reads to the model as a complete one — and
  the overflow is logged.

- 52cce19: Cut agent spend and false continuation failures: request the 1-hour prompt-cache TTL on the stable system+tools prefix (chunk boundaries average past the 5-minute default), split the system prompt so mid-turn resource churn no longer invalidates that prefix, consult the successor's claim on every failed durable-continuation dispatch, and engage the hosted resume default on A2A/MCP delegated turns.
- 52cce19: Harden agent run lifecycle recovery: sweep stale claimed runs on the fast
  periodic interval instead of only from client request paths, persist the
  partial turn on a no-progress recovery abort, emit reason-shaped terminal
  events (`auto_continue` / reason-coded error) instead of a synthetic `done`,
  make the chunk-boundary checkpoint durable the moment the soft timeout fires,
  and derive the foreground no-progress backstop and tool-timeout ceiling from
  the chunk budget so they can actually fire.
- 52cce19: `getRequestUserEmail()` no longer lets a request-scoped read silently inherit
  the process-wide `AGENT_USER_EMAIL` identity.

  Hand-written `/api/*` routes have no AsyncLocalStorage store of their own, so
  `getRequestUserEmail() ?? session?.email` resolved to the deploy env's identity
  in preference to the real signed-in user — an admin gate reading it admitted
  whoever `AGENT_USER_EMAIL` names, failing open toward more privilege. Three
  changes close that:
  - Every inbound HTTP request now runs inside a `RequestContext`, established by
    a request-boundary middleware at `~middleware[0]`. The store is deliberately
    identity-free (resolving a session there would mean reading cookies on the
    cached SSR shell path); handlers that do know their caller still nest their
    own `runWithRequestContext`, which shadows it.
  - `getAmbientUserEmail()` / `getAmbientOrgId()` name the process-wide identity
    explicitly, for the callers that legitimately have no request behind them:
    CLI invocations, cron and scheduled jobs, seed and QA scripts.
  - When a request-scoped read still reaches the ambient identity in a process
    that serves HTTP, it warns loudly and names the env identity instead of
    answering silently.

  App authors: a handler that relied on `getRequestUserEmail()` returning
  `AGENT_USER_EMAIL` outside an explicit context now gets `undefined` and should
  fail closed. Scripts and cron entrypoints that really do mean the process
  identity should call `getAmbientUserEmail()`.

  `guard:no-localhost-fallback` also now flags `?? process.env.AGENT_USER_EMAIL`
  and the `WORKSPACE_OWNER_EMAIL` owner-coercion shape in request-handling code.

- 52cce19: Make agent run outcomes measurable and stop dead workers from latching the in-flight reaper grace. Completed runs prune after a day while errored runs are kept for a week, so any wider window undercounted successes — `cleanupOldRuns` now folds each pruned run into an additive `agent_run_outcome_daily` counters table (read via `getRunOutcomeCounters`) so outcome rates survive pruning. The `in_flight_since` stale-reaper grace no longer applies to a run whose heartbeat and progress writes have both been dead longer than `IN_FLIGHT_GRACE_MAX_LIVENESS_GAP_MS`, so a worker that dies mid-tool surfaces in ~2 minutes instead of holding the full 14.5-minute grace.
- 52cce19: Stop scaffolded-app instructions from inviting oversized work on small prompts.

  Two reported failures from a Claude CLI session in a generated app: asked for a
  login screen with a placeholder test password, the agent wrote a Playwright
  script from scratch to verify it, then abandoned a half-written action and built
  three custom Nitro routes plus middleware instead.

  The verification half came from the shipped `frontend-design` skill, whose
  description fires on any UI work and whose Verification section told the agent
  to "verify with browser screenshots" with no size threshold. That section is now
  proportional: existing checks for a small change, browser tooling only when
  asked or when a multi-step flow cannot be confirmed otherwise, and never author
  a new browser-automation script or e2e harness for unrequested verification. The
  `qa` skill's description no longer matches ordinary bug fixing, and
  `adding-a-feature` now says a restyle or a screen with no new data model does
  not need all four areas.

  The routes half was not soft wording — the rule appears in every instruction
  file. It lost to the shipped examples, so the `actions` skill now carries a
  closed exception list, an explicit stop trigger for the moment a route file or
  guard middleware is about to be created, and a note that the templates' existing
  `/api/*` CRUD is a grandfathered baseline rather than a pattern to copy. The
  same stop trigger is mirrored into the scaffold, chat, workspace, and registry
  `AGENTS.md` files, which also gain a one-line "scale effort to the task" rule.

- 52cce19: Narrow the auto-load triggers on the `frontend-design`, `shadcn-ui`, and
  `self-modifying-code` skills so a routine UI edit no longer pulls a full skill
  body into context. `frontend-design` now fires on genuine design work instead
  of any web UI change, `shadcn-ui` no longer matches every project with a
  `components.json`, and `self-modifying-code` no longer matches every source
  edit. Skill bodies are unchanged; the vendored skills record the deliberate
  divergence from upstream in their frontmatter.
- 52cce19: Make the Slack entry in the integrations panel followable in a standalone app.
  The setup steps previously opened with "Open Settings → Messaging", a page that
  only exists in the Dispatch template, and then told users not to set
  `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` while the panel listed it as a required secret directly below.
  The steps now cover the scopes, tokens, Event Subscriptions request URL, and the
  `app_mention` subscription needed to @mention the agent in a thread, and they
  end with a way to confirm it works. The Dispatch managed-OAuth path is now a
  closing note instead of a blocking first step.
- 52cce19: Document the Slack-mention-to-Notion-row workflow end to end. The messaging docs now carry a worked example that connects the two halves nobody had joined up: getting mentions into the app, adding the opt-in provider API actions, storing `NOTION_API_KEY` in the encrypted vault (never `.env`, which the provider runtime deliberately does not read), sharing the Notion database with the integration to avoid the silent 404, the exact prompt to give the agent, the single app action it should write, and the failure signatures for each step. Localized into all ten shipped documentation locales.
- 52cce19: Stop charging every agent turn for guidance the model already reads elsewhere.
  The runtime system prompt restated whole tool descriptions: rule 5 repeated
  `refresh-screen`'s description nearly verbatim, rule 12 repeated every bullet of
  `manage-progress`'s start/update/complete discipline, rule 10 re-described
  `tool-search`, and the production `connect-builder` section restated the
  `builderEnabled` semantics and its "never send users to Builder org settings"
  guard three separate times. Deferred tools are loaded through `tool-search`, so
  the model always reads a tool's description before it can call the tool — the
  prompt only needs to say the capability exists and when it applies.

  Each of those now states its trigger and defers the mechanics to the tool
  description, and the two overlapping response-style sections merged into one
  (both told the model to "lead with the outcome"). Also dropped the arbitrary
  formatting prescriptions (bullet counts, nesting bans) and the dev-mode few-shot
  `bash` examples in favor of stating the intent. Security, anti-fabrication, and
  `db-*` isolation rules are unchanged.

  The default production prompt is ~9% smaller and the verbose variant ~17%, with
  no capability removed.

- 52cce19: Stop `/_agent-native/agent-engine/status` reporting a failed lookup as "no AI
  provider configured".

  The handler swallowed every error and returned `200 { configured: false }`. The
  client treats that as an authoritative answer, so a transient database failure
  gated the composer and told a user with a working key to go connect a provider.
  It now returns 503, which the client maps to its retryable `unavailable` state —
  the composer stays usable and the check retries instead of latching.

- 52cce19: Give `agent_runs.status` a value that means "truncated" so a run cut off at a budget, timeout, loop-limit, or no-progress boundary is no longer filed as `completed`. Truncations outnumbered genuine completions on some apps while being invisible to every success-rate query, and because retention keys off status they were deleted after a day while real errors survived a week — the most-reported failures were also the fastest to lose their evidence. `terminalStatusForEvent` now returns `completed` if and only if the terminal reason is `done`; `setRunTerminalReason` corrects a `completed` row to `truncated` for every writer that sets status before it knows the reason; and `cleanupOldRuns` / `listErroredRuns` treat truncations as the failures they are. Additive: `status` is plain TEXT, so no migration is needed.
- 52cce19: Credential resolution now distinguishes "no credential" from "could not read
  the credential store". A transient database failure during org membership or
  `app_secrets` lookup surfaces as a retryable error instead of the permanent
  "No LLM provider is connected" / "Builder keys are not configured" copy, and a
  failed org lookup is no longer memoized as "no org" for the rest of the
  request. `org_members` reads now go through one shared helper so the scheduler
  and org context cannot disagree about what a failed read means.
- 52cce19: Teach the visual-edit skill the `viewports` option for placing desktop and
  mobile frames of each route side by side, and generate the Design template's
  copy of the skill from the same constant so it can no longer drift back to the
  deprecated multi-action launch flow.
- 52cce19: Make a second organization stop silently orphaning vault credentials, and make
  cross-app capability discoverable at runtime.
  - `describeCredentialScopeGap` now also detects a key saved in a **different
    organization the caller belongs to**, so a credential miss reports the
    organization mismatch that caused it instead of only naming the missing key.
    Every `provider-api` "credential not configured" error picks this up.
  - `createOrganization` logs a loud warning when it creates an additional
    organization for an account that already belongs to one, naming the credential
    consequence. The existing inline notices only reach a human clicking through
    the UI; this covers app code and migration actions calling it directly.
  - New built-in `describe-workspace-apps` agent tool, available to every app. It
    reads each workspace peer's live `/.well-known/agent-card.json` and returns
    their purpose plus exact callable action names, so cross-app capability is
    discoverable without a hand-maintained catalog that goes stale.
  - `A2AClient.getAgentCard()` accepts an optional `timeoutMs`.

- 52cce19: Restructure the generated workspace `AGENTS.md` so the whole file actually
  reaches the model. It was 8,294 characters, and the compact prompt hard-slices
  each injected resource at 6,000, so the last ~2,300 characters — the entire
  "Adding Apps" workflow — were silently dropped from every workspace agent's
  system prompt with no build-time signal.

  The always-on layer is now 5,265 characters: purpose, a skills index placed
  immediately after the purpose line so truncation can never reach it, the core
  invariants, a framework-docs pointer, and the workspace action index. The
  long-form detail moved verbatim into two new workspace skills the agent loads on
  demand: `workspace-conventions` (docs and source lookup, shared vs app-owned
  code, file/blob storage, env and secrets, agent scratch files, Dispatch
  Resources) and `adding-workspace-apps` (classifying an "agent" request,
  scaffolding `apps/<app-name>`, discovery and descriptions, mounting and base
  paths, action-first data, database portability, finishing a chat-template app).
  No guidance was removed.

## 0.122.2

### Patch Changes

- 905bdba: Improve tool-input recovery, stale-run handling, and design-system routing reliability.

## 0.122.1

### Patch Changes

- c8a0bcf: Sign the A2A identity token's audience as the target's origin. Receivers derive their expected audience from `APP_URL`, which carries no app path, so a path-qualified audience could never match — every direct `actions/invoke` between workspace apps failed with "Invalid or expired A2A token".
- c8a0bcf: Allow agent-to-agent calls between apps in a locally running workspace. The gateway serves every app on loopback, so sibling A2A targets are private addresses by construction and `ssrfSafeFetch` rejected them as SSRF — making cross-app delegation fail locally with "refusing to fetch private/internal address". `ssrfSafeFetch` now accepts an `allowedPrivateOrigins` list and the A2A client passes the deployment's own gateway origin (never a request-supplied value).
- c8a0bcf: Bound Nitro dev-server startup recovery so a failed restart stops refreshing forever.
- c8a0bcf: Keep Manage agent as a dedicated linked destination at the bottom of settings navigation.

## 0.122.0

### Minor Changes

- 231aca6: Add `agent-native template` — pull later upstream first-party template changes into an app that was generated from a template, via a real per-file 3-way merge.

  `agent-native create` now records what a later merge needs in `agent-native.scaffold`: the exact `templateRef` the template came from, its `templateSource` (`github` / `bundled` / `local-checkout`), the `coreVersion`, and the app `shape`. The pristine upstream tree is stored as a git ref under `refs/agent-native/template-baseline/<app-path>` written entirely with plumbing and a throwaway index, so HEAD, the index, and the working tree are never touched.

  Commands:
  - `agent-native template status [app]` — recorded ref, latest ref, baseline health, and counts of upstream-changed and locally-modified files.
  - `agent-native template diff [app] [--to <ref>]` — read-only unified diff of what upstream changed.
  - `agent-native template sync [app] [--to <ref>] [--dry-run] [--force]` — 3-way merge upstream changes into the app. `--to` defaults to the ref matching the installed `@agent-native/core`, so `agent-native upgrade` followed by `agent-native template sync` is the coherent story.
  - `agent-native template baseline [app] [--ref <ref>] [--template <name>]` — record a baseline for an app scaffolded before provenance existed.
  - `agent-native template accept [app]` — advance the baseline after resolving conflicts.

  Secrets, lockfiles, generated output, pending changelog entries, and `learnings.md` are never merged; binary files are never marker-merged; and the baseline only advances when the merge came out clean.

- 231aca6: The runtime agent can now actually read skill `references/*.md` sub-files it is told about. Previously only `SKILL.md` content was bundled — sub-file names were advertised in the skills prompt block and via `docs-search`, but their content was never read into the bundle, so `docs-search --slug "skill-<name>"` could never return them. `readSkillsDir` now inlines eligible text sub-files (`.md`/`.txt`/`.json`, capped at 64KB/file and 256KB/skill) into a new `Skill.files` map, `docs-search` exposes each one under a resolvable `skill-<name>--<subpath>` slug, the skills prompt block hints at those resolvable slugs instead of bare filenames, and the Vite dev-server HMR watcher invalidates the bundle for any file under a skills directory (not just `SKILL.md`).
- 231aca6: Add `AGENT_NATIVE_SSR_CACHE`, a deployment-wide override for the SSR shell cache
  policy. The default is unchanged: SSR HTML and React Router `.data` are still
  stamped `public, max-age=600, stale-while-revalidate=604800, stale-if-error=3600`
  because the shell is impersonal — cookies are stripped before render and all
  personalization happens on the client. Set the variable to `off` for `no-store`,
  or to a duration such as `30s` / `5m` for a shorter freshness (the
  `stale-while-revalidate` window mirrors the chosen `max-age`, so a short
  freshness does not hand back a seven-day stale window). Unrecognized values warn
  and keep the default, so a typo cannot silently disable the CDN.

  Use it when your host does not purge its CDN on deploy, or when loaders return
  mutable public data and a post-mutation `useRevalidator()` re-reads a cached
  `.data` copy. The override is deliberately deployment-wide rather than
  per-route: a cache policy that varies per request is how one visitor's payload
  lands in another visitor's shared CDN entry. Turning it off shortens caching
  only — it does not make SSR personalized, and mutation-fresh app data still
  belongs in actions read through `useActionQuery` / `useActionMutation` with
  `useDbSync()` polling.

### Patch Changes

- 231aca6: Keep delegated agent (A2A) response text visible instead of flashing and
  vanishing. Remote response text is now tracked as ordered segments interleaved
  with the sub-agent's reasoning and tool calls, so nested "Asking <agent>" output
  reads like top-level chat output — markdown text, tools, and thinking in the
  order they happened.
- 231aca6: Add `creative-context` to the Analytics template's `requiredPackages` metadata. The Analytics template's `package.json` already depends on `@agent-native/creative-context` as a `workspace:*` dep, but the scaffolder's template metadata didn't list it, so scaffolding a workspace with Analytics but none of the other creative-context-dependent templates produced a dangling `workspace:*` reference and `pnpm install` failed with `ERR_PNPM_WORKSPACE_PKG_NOT_FOUND`.
- 231aca6: Attribute Builder agent branches to the requesting user instead of the connected credential's `BUILDER_USER_ID`, falling back to that user only when the caller's email is not a Space member.
- 231aca6: Stop an upstream provider error from reporting the Builder connection as broken.
  A gateway error arriving inside an already-authenticated stream is now only
  treated as a credential failure when the message names the credential; a bare
  "Unauthorized" is surfaced as `builder_model_unauthorized` ("the provider behind
  this model rejected the request") without recording an auth-failure marker.
  Builder auth-failure markers also expire after 15 minutes, matching provider
  markers, so a signed-in user can no longer be pinned to "not connected"
  indefinitely.
- 231aca6: Stop `render-data-widget` from stalling on large result sets. The tool is a pure
  echo — the model authors every row as tool-call arguments — so an uncapped table
  cost minutes of argument decode before anything rendered, and a 211-row answer
  was observed stalling for six minutes until the run heartbeat died. Rows are now
  clamped server-side (50 table rows, 200 chart points) with the existing
  `totalRows`/`sampledRows`/`truncated` flags set, and both the tool description
  and the framework prompts state the ceiling instead of asking for "compact real
  data" and forbidding markdown tables outright.
- 231aca6: Stop telling users "The agent stopped without sending a final message" while the
  agent is still working. A run row at a continuation chunk boundary is also
  `status: "completed"`, and SQL run subscriptions synthesized a bare `done` for
  it, so a client that reattached past the boundary event concluded the turn had
  ended while the chained successor run was still going. Subscriptions now re-emit
  the run's real terminal event (or an `auto_continue` derived from its
  `terminal_reason`) so the client keeps following the turn. The chat notice also
  waits for the stopped-without-text state to hold for a beat, so transport
  re-attach gaps no longer flash it.
- 231aca6: Expose `@agent-native/core/client/clipboard` as a public subpath so apps can use
  `writeClipboardText` (desktop bridge + `execCommand` fallback, returns whether
  the write landed) instead of hand-rolling `navigator.clipboard` calls that fail
  silently on insecure origins or an unfocused document.
- 231aca6: Fix `agent-native create --template design` scaffolding a workspace where every `/design` page 500'd. `shouldSkipScaffoldEntry` skipped the entire `.generated` directory, including `templates/design/.generated/bridge/*.generated.ts` — 10 git-tracked files that `DesignCanvas.tsx` and friends import at module load. `.generated/bridge` is now copied while ephemeral dev-time siblings like `actions-registry.ts` and `action-types.d.ts` are still skipped.
- 231aca6: Resolve Builder credentials through an email-based org fallback and a solo-workspace fallback so a transient org-context dropout no longer reports a connected Builder account as "not configured", and surface credential-store read failures as retryable.
- 231aca6: Fix the chat "Revert to here" action doing nothing when clicked. The menu item
  was shown whenever Code mode was on, regardless of whether a checkpoint had
  actually been saved for that turn, and every failure path reset the button to
  idle without any feedback. The action now only appears for turns that have a
  real checkpoint, restores by run id in a single request, and surfaces the
  server's error instead of failing silently.
- 231aca6: Create app now offers a "Connect Builder" action when Builder isn't connected, instead of dead-end prose. The create-app flow (popover and full-page NewWorkspaceAppFlow) tracks the structured `builder-unavailable` failure reason from `start-workspace-app-creation`, gives hard failures a destructive-styled affordance instead of the neutral muted box used for informational states, adds a "Try again" control for `builder-error`/`credential-store-unavailable`, and wires the "Connect Builder" button through the shared `useBuilderConnectFlow` hook so users can connect and retry without leaving the flow.
- 231aca6: Add an instruction-size check to `guard:agent-chat-context`. The compact prompt
  hard-slices each injected resource at 6,000 characters with no build-time
  signal, so template `AGENTS.md` files were silently losing their back half —
  analytics lost 39%, including its entire deep-analysis workflow section. The
  guard now reports every template's instruction size, fails on a new or growing
  overflow, and warns on the templates already over the cap.
- 231aca6: Teach the provider API substrate that a Notion token's `/users/me` name is a Notion-side integration label, not the caller's workspace, so agents stop reporting an unrelated product name when a page was simply never shared. Provider presets can now declare `accessErrorGuidance`, which is appended to request guidance on 401/403/404 responses.
- 231aca6: Fix existing users being stranded in their personal workspace instead of their company org.

  Request-time domain auto-join decided whether a user was still in a default workspace by
  comparing the workspace name to a name recomputed from the current session. Sessions minted
  by the framework's own Google OAuth and identity-SSO paths carry no display name while Better
  Auth sessions do, so the same account could match on one sign-in path and not another — and a
  renamed workspace, a changed provider display name, or any second org membership disabled the
  auto-join permanently. It now keys off whether the user already belongs to an org whose
  `allowed_domain` matches their email domain, which is the durable signal.

  Joining is now also separated from activating: the company org is always joined, but the user
  is only switched into it when their current workspace is one they solely own. Members of a
  shared team stay where they are.

  Also fixes two recovery paths that hid the manual way in: Settings → Team now shows the
  "Join your team" card even when the user already has a (personal) workspace, and the Dispatch
  sidebar keeps an icon-only workspace switcher when collapsed instead of dropping it.

- 231aca6: Fix scaffolded workspace packages (pinpoint, embedding, creative-context,
  scheduling) never building their `dist/` on install, which broke the Slides
  deck editor and Design app with unresolved `@agent-native/*` imports.
  `scaffoldRequiredPackages()` now adds a `prepare` script alongside each
  package's existing `build` script, so pnpm builds it during `pnpm install`.
- 231aca6: Scope developer-workflow skills (design-exploration, visual-answer, visual-edit, visual-plan, visual-recap, visualize-repo) to `dev` only so they no longer load into the in-app runtime agent's context.
- 231aca6: Let org service tokens (`svc-<name>@service.<orgId>`) resolve an implicit
  `member` role for their own org via `implicitServiceOrgRole`, so templates that
  authorize against `org_members` can accept them for org-scoped actions instead
  of returning 403. The role is always `member` and requires the request's org id
  to independently corroborate the target org, so admin-gated operations —
  including minting or revoking further service tokens — stay closed.
- 231aca6: Fix messaging-integration (Slack) runs that answered "The model finished without a visible answer" and whose **Open thread** button landed on an empty Dispatch chat.
  - **Research-shaped asks no longer die at 40s.** `processIntegrationTask` hardcoded the 40s foreground soft-timeout even when durable dispatch had routed the task to the emitted Netlify `-background` function (~15min budget). Any multi-source request — sweep Gong, HubSpot, a Slack channel and Pylon, then summarize — was aborted at a continuation boundary with no user-facing text. The run now takes the background ceiling when `isInBackgroundFunctionRuntime()` proves it is inside that function, so the ~60s synchronous wall still governs everywhere it actually applies.
  - **A cut-off run says so.** A run that stops at an `auto_continue` boundary is no longer reported as a model that answered with nothing; it now says it ran out of time, points at the thread for the work it did gather, and suggests asking in smaller pieces.
  - **The Open thread deep link resolves.** A channel conversation runs as the integration service principal, so its thread is owned by `integration@<platform>` and the deep link 404'd for the human who asked — Dispatch silently rendered a brand-new empty chat instead. Each verified participant is now granted an explicit editor share on the thread they are driving (`grantThreadUserShare`, idempotent and never downgrading an existing stronger role), so the button opens the real conversation and it appears in their Dispatch history.

- 231aca6: Fix every `pnpm action` in a Slides app failing with "nitroApp.h3 is not available" — the Slides db plugin now skips readiness-gate middleware registration when invoked by the CLI runner, which supplies no h3 app.
- 231aca6: Cut the "Generative UI and Extensions" block in the in-app runtime agent's system prompt down to a short pointer. The removed prose (helper API list, `update-extension` operation contract, get-extension/list-extensions/legacy-`tools`-table guidance, the 7-row extension-vs-code-change routing table, and worked examples) already exists verbatim in the `render-inline-extension`/`create-extension`/`update-extension`/`connect-builder` tool descriptions, in `shared-rules.ts`'s single copy of the db-tools rule, and in the `extensions`/`generative-ui` skills — this only removes the duplicate copy from the prompt paid on every turn. Kept in place: the app-native-artifact-first rule, the "don't send existing extension edits to `connect-builder`" guardrail, and the extension-can't-reach-native-chrome boundary sentence, none of which have another home.

  Full base prompt's extension block: ~7.7KB → ~1.8KB. Compact base prompt's extension block: ~4.2KB → ~1.6KB (the compact base prompt shrinks by about 2.5KB total, roughly 14% of its prior size).

- 231aca6: Remove duplicated guidance from the in-app runtime agent's system prompt. Anthropic's guidance is that overlapping/conflicting instructions are handled worse by modern models than a single clear statement, and that tool-level detail belongs in tool descriptions rather than being repeated in the system prompt.
  - Production (tool) mode no longer re-lists every action's name and truncated description in `## Available Actions` — the native tool schemas already carry that. Only native-chat-widget annotations and a `tool-search` pointer for actions outside the initial tool set remain (dev/CLI mode, where template actions are invoked via `pnpm action` and are not native tools, is unchanged).
  - The Navigation Rule, previously stated once as a numbered core rule and again in its own section, is now stated once.
  - The three overlapping anti-fabrication / no-fake-success / verify-before-claiming-done rules are consolidated into one rule with three clearly labeled sub-behaviors (don't fabricate data, don't fabricate success, recover instead of giving up), removing a rule that existed only to explain how it differed from the other two.
  - The "Extended Capabilities" section no longer repeats "call `get-framework-context` with key X" once per capability for capabilities the tool's own topic list already documents; it collapses to one line, keeping only the agent-teams delegation-intent guidance and the call-agent warning that carry unique, non-redundant behavior.

  Full framework core prompt shrinks by roughly 1.8 KB (~10%); the already-condensed compact variant shrinks by a smaller amount since it had less of this duplication to begin with. The tool-mode `## Available Actions` block shrinks by an amount proportional to the number of registered actions (roughly 85%+ for typical action counts), since it stops repeating what the native tool schema already tells the model.

## 0.121.0

### Minor Changes

- 4e64dd1: Realtime sync: two hosted-gateway follow-ups. Both are opt-in and leave apps without hosted-realtime config unchanged.
  - Hosted SSE reconnect now sends the client's cursor (`&since=`) on the gateway stream URL, so the gateway's connect-time catch-up replays events written during the reconnect gap immediately instead of deferring them to the next poll. First connect (cursor 0) is unaffected. Because a `since=` only takes effect when a new `EventSource` is constructed (the browser's own auto-reconnect reuses the URL frozen at construction), the hosted transport now owns reconnects: on a stream error it closes the stream and schedules its own reconnect so the next connect rebuilds the URL from the current cursor, keeping the token on transient errors and reminting on a closed stream. A late error from a replaced (stale) stream is ignored so it cannot tear down the current one. Local mode keeps native EventSource reconnect.
  - New gateway access-check tokens (`signGatewayAccessToken`/`verifyGatewayAccessToken`, exported from `./server/short-lived-token`): per-project HMAC key, a `typ` discriminator (not interchangeable with subscribe or media tokens), and the full access query (`resourceType`/`resourceId`/`userEmail`/`orgId`) bound into the signature so the app authenticates the params, not just the caller. `verifyGatewayAccessToken` also accepts an optional expected `projectId` to bind the channel (mirroring `verifyRealtimeSubscribeToken`); the `can-see` endpoint passes its own project id when known.
  - New endpoint `GET /_agent-native/can-see` mounted by core-routes. The hosted Realtime Gateway has no copy of an app's shareable-resource registry, so it calls this to resolve sharee visibility: the endpoint verifies a gateway access-check token against the app's per-project secret, runs the app's registry-based `resolveAccess`, and returns `{ allowed }`. Fails closed (`allowed: false`) on an unknown resource type or lookup error; 404 when the app has no realtime secret; `Cache-Control: private, no-store`.
  - New `AppSyncStateOptions.dbAssignedVersions` (default off): allocate durable-event versions from the app's Postgres DB — a one-row allocator advanced with `GREATEST(v + 1, epoch_ms_now)` inside the same autocommit insert statement — instead of the per-writer in-memory clock counter. Hosted realtime has multiple writers per app DB (the app's serverless instances plus gateway instances), where clock skew can assign a LOWER version to a LATER event and a client whose cursor passed the higher value filters the later event out permanently; DB allocation serializes on the allocator row's lock so version order equals commit order across all writers. Buffer/emit defer until the allocated version returns (no provisional version ever reaches clients); a deterministic-id dedupe loser adopts the winner's version via `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE ... RETURNING`; on DB failure the writer falls back to clock allocation (logged) so the in-process fast path never stalls. Versions stay epoch-ms scale, so existing cursors, seeds, and lag metrics are unaffected. The default instance enables this automatically when `AGENT_NATIVE_REALTIME_TRANSPORT=hosted` with a gateway URL; self-hosted apps are byte-identical. Postgres only.

## 0.120.0

### Minor Changes

- 20ebb96: `agent-native dev --inspect` (and `--inspect-brk`, optionally `=<port>`) now
  attaches the Node inspector to **only** the Nitro API-server process, on a
  single known port (default 9229). It selects Nitro's `node-process` dev runner
  so the server is a real, attachable process, and injects `NODE_OPTIONS` through
  a Vite preload that runs before Vite's own startup — so Vite, pnpm, and the CLI
  are never inspected and there is exactly one debugger target. Set
  `NITRO_DEV_RUNNER` yourself to override the runner.

## 0.119.5

### Patch Changes

- 13eb9f7: Fix AI SDK provider engines being unusable on bundled serverless deploys, and stop rewriting custom model IDs on save/read.
  - **Serverless package detection.** `isAgentEnginePackageInstalled` relied on `require.resolve`, which fails on bundled serverless runtimes (Vercel/Netlify via Nitro) where optional provider packages (`ai`, `@ai-sdk/*`) are inlined into the function bundle. Every engine-usability gate then rejected the AI SDK engines and the agent silently fell back to the native Anthropic engine. Package resolution now treats a resolve miss as available only when there is real evidence of a bundled runtime (Vercel/Netlify markers, or a bundle-output module path), and defers to the engine's own dynamic `import()` as the real gate. Generic container/Lambda/Cloud Run deploys that ship a real `node_modules` still surface genuine "package not installed" misses.
  - **Custom model preservation.** `normalizeModelForEngine` replaced any unrecognized model ID with the engine default when the settings actions passed a static registry entry, so a custom OpenAI-compatible gateway model (e.g. an Ollama model) reverted to the OpenAI default on save and read. The set/list/app-default actions now resolve the OpenAI-compatible-endpoint capability (`resolveEnginePreservesCustomModels`) and pass it through, preserving custom IDs verbatim — including version-shaped IDs — while first-party OpenAI still normalizes unknown IDs to a supported model.

## 0.117.1

### Patch Changes

- c9e48ca: Fix Vercel workspace serverless functions crashing on every request. The generated Vercel function wrapper now exports the `{ fetch }` web-handler shape so Vercel invokes it web-style with a Web `Request`, and requires a Web `fetch` handler from `main.mjs` rather than forwarding a Web `Request` to a Node-style `(req, res)` handler (fixes #2324).

## 0.117.0

### Minor Changes

- d73eda3: Realtime sync: framework prerequisites for the hosted Realtime Sync Gateway. All new behavior is opt-in — apps without hosted-realtime config are unchanged.
  - Refactor `poll.ts` into an `AppSyncState` class holding all previously module-global change-tracking state (version counter, ring buffer, poll emitter, watermarks, and the access cache). Module-level exports (`recordChange`, `getVersion`, `getPollEmitter`, `getChangesSinceForUser`, `canSeeChangeForUser`, `createPollHandler`, `invalidateCollabAccessCache`) delegate to a lazily-created default instance bound to the process DB, so self-hosted apps are unchanged. `createPollHandler` and `createPollEventsHandler` accept an optional injected `AppSyncState`.
  - `AppSyncState` accepts an injected DB accessor and access resolver, and exposes `getCombinedChangesSinceForUser`/`checkExternalDbChanges`/`persistSyncEvent` for reuse. `ddl-guard` helpers keep the guarded Postgres DDL path for injected per-app clients.
  - The per-user access cache key now includes the active `orgId`, so a decision cached in one org is never reused under another org's session.
  - Add `readMinSyncEventVersion()` (oldest retained durable version) for stale-cursor detection, and an opt-in `deterministicEventIds` mode so multiple processes detecting the same out-of-band write collapse to one durable row. Both off/unused by default.
  - New public export subpaths: `./server/poll`, `./server/sse`, `./server/short-lived-token`.
  - New realtime subscribe tokens: `signRealtimeSubscribeToken`/`verifyRealtimeSubscribeToken` — per-project HMAC key, identity-bearing claims (`owner`/`orgId` required), `projectId` channel binding, and a `typ` discriminator so they are not interchangeable with media tokens. Existing `signShortLivedToken`/`verifyShortLivedToken` are untouched.
  - New session-gated, same-origin endpoint `GET /_agent-native/realtime-token` mounted by core-routes. Fail-closed: responds 404 unless the app is provisioned with a per-project signing secret (`AGENT_NATIVE_REALTIME_HMAC_SECRET`) and a Builder project id; responses are `Cache-Control: private, no-store`.
  - New shared realtime wire protocol (`realtime-protocol.ts`, re-exported from `./server/sse`): named SSE `handshake`/`token` control frames; data/batch frames unchanged.
  - Client transport (`useDbSync`/`subscribeSyncEvents`) gains an opt-in hosted-gateway mode, enabled only when the SSR config sets `realtime.transport = "hosted"` with an explicit gateway URL: token mint/rotation, jittered reconnects, and automatic health-gated fallback to the app's own `/poll` + `/events`. `onSseStateChange` callbacks now also receive the negotiated capability list (optional second parameter; existing callbacks are unaffected), which collab uses to keep its fast presence cadence on `no-awareness` streams.

## 0.116.0

### Minor Changes

- 03a043e: Improve Agent Resources settings with contextual documentation links, cleaner file empty states, and file-name creation that defaults extensionless files to Markdown.
- 03a043e: Add explicit collaboration access modes for resource-scoped and intentionally
  deployment-wide authenticated documents, with legacy compatibility and Doctor
  guidance for implicit configurations.
- 03a043e: Add a catalog-driven in-chat MCP connection suggestion that recognizes Granola
  and resumes the pending chat request after OAuth or direct connection setup.

### Patch Changes

- 03a043e: Expose the Google Drive workspace connection and provider API to Analytics for Google Sheets exports.
- 03a043e: Make realtime voice the clear primary microphone action, remember the selected input mode, improve speech waveform responsiveness, and show a shine while the voice agent is working.
- 03a043e: Prevent reasoning messages from losing their assistant UI provider, and add a progressively disclosed recent-chat rail for app sidebars.
- 03a043e: Improve the MCP device authorization success message hierarchy by separating the confirmation title from the follow-up connection guidance.
- 03a043e: Keep page-chat controls clear of messages, continue shared sync in background tabs at a relaxed cadence, and make the latest tool visibly active until the turn finishes.
- 03a043e: Trim the MCP connection authorization page by removing redundant branding and status pills.
- 03a043e: Make template feedback controls opt in through `VITE_AGENT_NATIVE_FEEDBACK_URL` so cloned apps do not send feedback to Agent-Native by default.
- 03a043e: Ensure interrupted or empty agent runs always end with a visible final response instead of a bare tool call.
- 03a043e: Keep the active chat tab fully visible while the right sidebar opens and its tab strip expands.

### Patch Changes

- 2154ad1: Fix Builder preview credential relay failing behind a proxy. The relay handler now derives the request origin from `x-forwarded-host`/`x-forwarded-proto` (via `getBuilderBrowserOriginForEvent`) instead of the internal loopback host, so `targetOrigin` verification passes on hosted preview deployments.

### Patch Changes

- f0601ec: Collapse duplicate assistant tool-call ids in the shared agent loop so providers do not reject replayed tool-call history.

## 0.115.1

### Patch Changes

- 321567c: Add `app-branding` and `app-permissions` to the default framework skill set. `app-branding` is layout-aware — it handles both the centralized `app/lib/app-config.ts` source-of-truth layout and the inlined layout where the name/title live across `package.json`, route `meta()`, and `app/root.tsx`. Generated apps using `frameworkSkills: "default"` now receive both skills on scaffold and `skills update`.

## 0.115.0

### Minor Changes

- 0341a7d: Allow the published CLI to scaffold the hidden CRM template explicitly, and include factory-backed actions in production static registries.

### Patch Changes

- 0341a7d: Allow hosted authenticated requests to use deployment-level transactional email configuration.
- 0341a7d: Keep Netlify-hosted apps and their databases warm with site-local scheduled health checks.
- 0341a7d: Prevent duplicate Thinking statuses and scroll bounce during streamed reasoning, while giving active tool rows a clear live state and new tool rows a subtle entrance.
- 0341a7d: Require an explicit workspace connection when making Salesforce provider API requests, so each request uses a matched instance URL and OAuth account.
- 0341a7d: Prevent model gateways from breaking extension edits by using a compact required update contract and normalizing optional placeholder arguments before validation.
- 0341a7d: Fix Salesforce token refresh when configured with Consumer Key/Secret.
- 0341a7d: Allow recurring jobs to bind an explicit MCP tool allowlist and resolve those connected capabilities with the job's existing user/org OAuth context.
- 0341a7d: Teach the agent-native-docs skill to reuse node_modules reference source with rg and cp: version-matched installed source beats web docs, and every first-party template's corpus is fair game to copy and adapt, not just runtime internals that need the customizing-agent-native ladder.
- 0341a7d: Make the missing-AI composer state visibly actionable with a Connect AI button.
- Updated dependencies [0341a7d]

## 0.114.16

### Patch Changes

- 3a3eb9a: Fix `npx @agent-native/core create` failing with `spawn tsx ENOENT`. The CLI launcher's tsx source fallback is now scoped to monorepo source checkouts, so installed packages always run the shipped `dist` build even when tarball extraction leaves `.ts` files newer than their compiled `.js`.

## 0.114.3

### Patch Changes

- c47eb50: fix(core): keep feature-flag definitions out of the browser server graph

  App-shared config that imported feature-flag definitions from
  `@agent-native/core/feature-flags` pulled the barrel's server re-exports
  (`store` → `settings/store` → `db/client` → request telemetry) into the client
  dev graph. Vite's dev server does not tree-shake, so the browser evaluated that
  server chain and `request-telemetry`'s top-level `new AsyncLocalStorage()` threw
  against the externalized `node:async_hooks` stub, breaking app load in dev
  (production tree-shakes it away and was unaffected).
  - Add a client-safe `@agent-native/core/feature-flags/registry` entry for
    `defineFeatureFlag` / `defineFeatureFlags` / `registerFeatureFlags` so shared
    config no longer imports the server barrel.
  - Make `db/request-telemetry` and `settings/store` resolve `AsyncLocalStorage` /
    `EventEmitter` lazily via `process.getBuiltinModule` (matching
    `server/request-context`) instead of a top-level value import, so the modules
    can be evaluated in any runtime without tripping the browser stub.
  - Add a regression guard asserting the client-safe registry entry never reaches
    the server layer and that those modules never statically value-import the
    builtins.

## 0.114.2

### Patch Changes

- 3253e1d: Teach generated agents to discover Toolkit capabilities before composing or ejecting shared features.

## 0.114.1

### Patch Changes

- c913280: Keep action mutations pending until asynchronous success callbacks finish.
- c913280: Allow email-password signup without email verification on Netlify deploy previews while preserving explicit verification overrides, and hold auth requests until their serverless routes finish mounting.

- e53a34e: Add reusable provider API and staged dataset action factories, including opt-in custom provider registration and sanitized provider request audit summaries that narrow recorded audit metadata to safe request context.

### Patch Changes

- e53a34e: Add a subscription-only Claude Code participant runtime with enforced read-only and driver permissions.
- e53a34e: Add a ChatGPT-subscription Codex CLI participant runtime with enforced read-only and driver sandboxes.
- e53a34e: Add durable, fenced local state for compound multi-frontier runs.
- e53a34e: Move the reusable ChatHistoryList and its stylesheet to the Toolkit chat-history entrypoint while preserving Core compatibility imports. Adopt it across first-party full-page chat sidebars, ship readable Toolkit source, and add generated-app guidance for selective app-owned UI customization.
- e53a34e: Keep interrupted local Codex runs paused and resumable across every runner command.

## 0.111.0

### Minor Changes

- 01a3f27: BREAKING: move the portable composer, rich editor, collaboration display, visual controls, and shared UI primitives to focused Toolkit entrypoints. Core's removed deep compatibility paths now throw an actionable migration error, and moved symbols are removed from the legacy `@agent-native/core/client` barrel. Run `npx @agent-native/core@latest upgrade --codemods --yes` to rewrite supported imports. Framework-wired composer APIs remain available from `@agent-native/core/client/composer`; bare reusable composer UI is available from `@agent-native/toolkit/composer`.

### Patch Changes

## 0.109.0

### Minor Changes

- 6cd2c79: Add audience-bound direct invocation for explicitly exposed read-only actions so sibling apps can skip a second agent loop for bounded data operations.
  Add shared Slack and Notion corpus recipes so cursor pagination runs inside one resumable data operation instead of one model turn per page.

### Patch Changes

- 6cd2c79: Prevent cross-turn chat stream splicing and link browser sessions and session replays to agent-chat threads and runs.
- 6cd2c79: Resume existing A2A tasks after bounded waits so cross-app agents do not duplicate long-running work.
- 6cd2c79: Make progress tracking tolerate blank optional status fields, make extension replacement guard errors retryable when the explicit intent flag is missing, expose extension readiness callbacks for host loading states, show the underlying repeated tool error in agent stop messages, and avoid MCP connection suggestions based on hidden tool payloads.
- 6cd2c79: Show image attachments in queued agent chat messages.
- 6cd2c79: Open shared chat-thread links in the matching full-page chat or agent sidebar.
- 6cd2c79: Ignore stackless stale module-loader failures that are handled by route-chunk recovery instead of creating noisy error issues.
- 6cd2c79: Keep long agent-chat tool histories compact by collapsing older calls behind a "Ran N tools" disclosure.

- a485fbe: Add one-click OAuth connections for standard remote MCP servers and shared workspace providers, including GitHub, Figma, Google Drive, HubSpot, Jira Cloud, Notion, and Sentry. OAuth credentials are encrypted and refreshed per user or organization without exposing tokens to browsers or MCP App iframes. Existing API-key and token credentials remain available as explicit fallbacks, and provider API requests can use an OAuth-backed workspace connection.
- a485fbe: Redesign the agent workspace with plain files first, dedicated resource collections, and a snapshots view for recent context inspection.
- a485fbe: Add public session replay context and timestamped Analytics links, support host-owned tracking identity, and allow Analytics replay pages to open at a requested timeline offset.

  - @agent-native/recap-cli@0.4.2

## 0.103.1

### Patch Changes

- f512fd2: Keep Cloudflare template builds deployable when browser-only editor and chat packages import input-rule and message-part runtime helpers.

## 0.103.0

### Minor Changes

- 0af0783: Let Content connect manifest-declared local folders to its normal database-backed workspace without enabling a separate local-file data mode.

## 0.102.2

### Patch Changes

- 76a9cca: Improve MCP connection status and make provider connection errors actionable.
- 76a9cca: Keep queued chat follow-ups draining after fast turns and route cross-origin Assets pickers through a top-level sign-in-safe handoff.
- 76a9cca: Recover the Agent panel when a stale lazy-loaded chat chunk fails to load.
- 76a9cca: Keep the Builder source-change handoff card visible outside the collapsed chat work summary.

## 0.102.1

### Patch Changes

- ab33ae7: Make the Agent Files tab taller and viewport-responsive, and let file previews fill the panel height with natural scrolling.

## 0.102.0

### Minor Changes

- 6498492: Add the Tasks template app — a task-list-first agent-native workspace with inbox triage, custom fields, and full action parity for UI and agent.

## 0.101.14

### Patch Changes

- 866d8f0: Bundle the Chat template in the CLI package and download GitHub fallbacks directly from codeload for faster, more reliable scaffolding.
- 866d8f0: Polish the chat sidebar header by hiding mode tabs and moving full-view navigation into the icon row.

## 0.101.13

### Patch Changes

- e503433: Keep CLI repository downloads asynchronous and challenge bare loopback MCP URLs for OAuth clients.
- e503433: Keep completed chat work disclosures collapsed and stable when submitting a later message.
- e503433: Remove the automatic first-session personalization questions from agent chat so new requests are handled directly.

## 0.101.12

### Patch Changes

- 2ff004e: Fix workspace-file resolution and run-code paging/routing edge cases. `contentFromWorkspaceFile` now resolves the same file the run-code `workspaceRead`/`workspaceWrite` bridge sees (bridge scope first, then Resources), and fails closed on a bridge read error instead of silently falling back to a possibly-different same-path Resources body. `workspaceRead` returns null instead of a silently truncated prefix when a later page fails, and the run-code bridge now returns a distinct "not registered" (404) error for unknown tools instead of a misleading read-only access error.

## 0.101.11

### Patch Changes

- fd0ddb8: Wait for agent-card and A2A routes to finish initializing on cold starts, preserve human approval gates across A2A tasks, and carry exact one-time chat authorization through authenticated agent delegation.

## 0.101.10

### Patch Changes

- 3453dd3: Allow review hosts to attach a composer target, anchor, metadata, and visible context while independently controlling agent dispatch, and keep comment-only composers human-routed.

## 0.101.9

### Patch Changes

- bc29c82: Retry visual recap publishing once with a focused source-repair turn when the hosted Plan parser rejects malformed MDX.
- Updated dependencies [bc29c82]
  - @agent-native/recap-cli@0.4.1

## 0.101.8

### Patch Changes

- b023dad: Keep Builder account connection available when an app does not configure the separate Builder branch-creation capability, and describe preview relay setup failures before authorization accurately.
- b023dad: Show Builder connection setup in Settings and use a content-blocker-safe status route.
- b023dad: Relay Builder authorization securely from an approved callback deployment into an exact allowlisted, immutable preview origin, with deploy-specific Netlify permalinks, a 32+ character shared HMAC secret, and bounded relay request bodies.

## 0.101.7

### Patch Changes

- 70caa6f: Preserve participant-visible integration replies and verified artifact identities so threaded corrections can reliably target resources after renames.

## 0.101.6

### Patch Changes

- dd47e0a: Clarify how to add a UI later while preserving a headless app's shared action and data contract.

## 0.101.5

### Patch Changes

- 9dd88f4: Opt the dedicated `get-code-execution` and `refresh-screen` volatile reads out of the duplicate read-only tool-call guard via the new `dedupe: false` action option while retaining default duplicate protection for normal `run-code` executions. Also raise `get-extension` and `get-extension-history-version` result caps to 500,000 and 2,000,000 characters respectively so JSON serialization overhead cannot slice mid-content and corrupt source reads for large extensions or their history.
- 9dd88f4: Prevent repeated read-only tool loops while preserving trimmed results, allow volatile reads to opt out of deduping, and enforce notification webhook allowlists at the scope that supplied each secret.

## 0.101.4

### Patch Changes

- 7d72df1: Keep chat responsive while replaying dense agent event bursts, and surface safe cancellation when a live background run has gone quiet.
- 7d72df1: Bundle one complete Yjs runtime into serverless deploy output so SSR starts without missing named exports.

## 0.101.3

### Patch Changes

- 7cfb087: Keep centered chat composer skeletons aligned with the real composer while the chat UI loads.
- 7cfb087: Document PR Visual Recap's cost drivers and cheaper model options (`claude-haiku-4-5`, `gpt-5.6-luna`/`gpt-5.6-terra`, `openai-compatible` providers), and note that the Claude backend now defaults to `claude-sonnet-5` when `VISUAL_RECAP_MODEL` is unset. Adds a matching cost/model-choice section to the Visual Plans template doc.
- 7cfb087: Fail closed when first-party scaffolds cannot be downloaded from the CLI's immutable core version tags instead of mixing newer templates with an older runtime.
- 7cfb087: Resolve `${keys.NAME}` in the agent fetch tool and notification webhooks through the request-scope cascade so Dispatch-vault keys scoped to the workspace/org resolve like they already do for extensions and automations.
- 7cfb087: Resolve provider credentials from encrypted Dispatch vault secrets, keep hosted A2A agent discovery distinct from mounted workspace app inventory, and run long Analytics A2A tasks on the durable background worker.
- 7cfb087: Expose the embedded OG font resolver so template social images keep their text visible in serverless runtimes.
- 7cfb087: Stop agent turns from looping across alternating read-only docs and source search tools.
- 7cfb087: Publish PR Visual Recap helpers as a dependency-light CLI package so recap workflows no longer install the full Agent-Native framework dependency graph.
- 7cfb087: Derive workspace-shared secret encryption material from A2A_SECRET on hosted workspace deploys so vault keys decrypt across sibling apps, and stop serving stale shared ciphertext after a value is updated without shared key material.

## 0.101.2

### Patch Changes

- 616e2b9: Copying an assistant message now preserves formatting when pasting into apps
  that read rich clipboard content (e.g. Slack), while still pasting as markdown
  in editors like Notion. Falls back to plain-text copy where the browser does
  not support rich clipboard writes.

## 0.101.1

### Patch Changes

- f25194e: Keep centered chat composer skeletons aligned with the real composer while the chat UI loads.
- f25194e: Document PR Visual Recap's cost drivers and cheaper model options (`claude-haiku-4-5`, `gpt-5.6-luna`/`gpt-5.6-terra`, `openai-compatible` providers), and note that the Claude backend now defaults to `claude-sonnet-5` when `VISUAL_RECAP_MODEL` is unset.

## 0.101.0

### Minor Changes

- fb281f4: Export first-class A2A auth primitives for the HTTP action route so workspaces
  stop reaching into core internals:
  - `verifyA2AToken` (and `A2ATokenPayload`) from `@agent-native/core/a2a` — the
    same verifier the `/_agent-native/a2a` endpoint uses, including org-level
    fallback secrets. Apps no longer need to reimplement a partial HS256 verifier.
  - `AGENT_RUN_OWNER_CONTEXT_KEY`, `seedAgentRunOwnerContext`, and
    `AgentRunOwnerContext` from `@agent-native/core/server` — a typed contract for
    pre-seeding the resolved caller, replacing the hardcoded context-key string.
  - A new `actionRouteAuth` option on `createAgentChatPlugin` (and `ActionRouteAuthAdapter`
    / `actionRouteAuth` on `mountActionRoutes`). Its `resolveCaller` runs before
    the `getSession` chain on `/_agent-native/actions/*`, letting apps accept A2A
    JWTs declaratively instead of intercepting Nitro's `request` hook. Returning
    `null` defers to the existing framework auth chain; throwing hard-rejects the
    request with a 401 so an invalid credential can't fall through to a
    same-origin session cookie. A resolved caller's org comes exclusively from
    the verified credential — the adapter-returned `orgId`
    (`ActionRouteResolvedCaller`) or the owner-email membership lookup — never
    from ambient session/org cookie state, so a request carrying both a valid
    A2A bearer and an unrelated browser cookie can't execute under the cookie
    user's org. A2A writes stay org-scoped.

  All additive — existing callers are unaffected.

## 0.100.4

### Patch Changes

- f2ed084: Add public-safe review reads and client gating, root-thread agent routing, durable resolution notes, and capability-aware review panels.

## 0.100.3

### Patch Changes

- a6742d1: Publish PR Visual Recap helpers as a dependency-light CLI package so recap workflows no longer install the full Agent-Native framework dependency graph.
- Updated dependencies [a6742d1]
  - @agent-native/recap-cli@0.2.0

## 0.100.2

- f8cf755: Fix Slack integration fallbacks and link replies directly to Dispatch chat threads.
- f8cf755: Keep workspace-shared app secrets decryptable across sibling apps.

## 0.100.1

### Patch Changes

- 037cc3a: Validate explicit Calendar and Mail connector catalog actions through the external MCP lifecycle.

## 0.100.0

### Minor Changes

- 8e6f022: Add an Agent Jobs page tab for recurring jobs and personal automations, with scoped status views and management controls.
- 8e6f022: Add the full-page Agent surface with scoped Context, Files, Connections, Jobs, and Access tabs, plus shared MCP connection guidance.
- 8e6f022: Expose system-prompt sections in Context X-Ray and add a no-thread context preview with provenance, governance, and token breakdowns.

### Patch Changes

- 8e6f022: Document the full-page Agent surface, its tab responsibilities, and the in-app external-client Access flow.
- 8e6f022: Align fullscreen chat thread width with the composer width.
- 8e6f022: Preserve the registered root Google OAuth callback for workspace apps when deploy-time workspace metadata is available but a runtime relay flag is missing.
- 8e6f022: Recover reasoning-only model completions before app-specific final-answer guards run, and keep guards anchored to the original user request across internal continuations.

## 0.99.3

### Patch Changes

- 03cd25c: Document the `agent-native invoke` CLI usage and flags on the A2A protocol docs page, across all locales.

## 0.99.2

### Patch Changes

- 34b4f29: Keep Demo mode browser-local so backend actions and agent/MCP results retain real access-scoped data.
- 34b4f29: Fix 404s when client-side navigating from the dispatch shell into a mounted workspace sub-app's root route. React Router's `.data` loader-fetch convention (e.g. `/coach.data`) didn't match either deployment platform's per-app routing rules (`basePath` / `basePath/*`), so the request fell through to a bare 404 before reaching the app's own server, leaving the sub-app stuck retrying its own action/agent-chat calls afterward.
- 34b4f29: Keep the latest reasoning thought expanded until a newer thought arrives, then animate the previous thought closed.
- 34b4f29: Preserve native browser link behavior when opening embedded extensions in their full view.
- 34b4f29: Keep chat composers editable while AI provider readiness is loading.
- 34b4f29: Record framework-owned Design preview iframes in session replays with the same privacy masking as the host page.
- 34b4f29: Remove the extension viewer's View / edit source button.
- 34b4f29: Retry transient chat-thread database failures so completed agent responses are not surfaced as unsaved.

## 0.99.1

### Patch Changes

- 7effaba: Ignore malformed collaboration presence payloads and keep recoverable server chat timeout handoffs out of Sentry error issues.
- 7effaba: Fix mounted app auth and OAuth URL resolution when Vite build-time base paths are not present in the runtime environment.
- 7effaba: Make delegated agent retries and agent-team runs use the model-aware output budget, so MCP/A2A investigations and background sub-agents can reach real data tools across model families.
- Updated dependencies [7effaba]
  - @agent-native/toolkit@0.4.10

## 0.99.0

### Minor Changes

- 3c3a59d: Return durable task handles for long-running MCP agent requests and expose
  grant-checked status polling instead of holding one MCP tool call open for the
  full agent run.

### Patch Changes

- 3c3a59d: Add Atlassian Rovo MCP to the built-in integration catalog with Jira setup guidance.
- 3c3a59d: Keep delegated A2A agent runs aligned with interactive prompt context and request-scoped browser access.
- 3c3a59d: Keep anonymous SSR shells long-cacheable across hosting providers and keep viewer-specific data on client/API paths.
- 3c3a59d: Add `/mcp` as the canonical public MCP URL while preserving `/_agent-native/mcp` for existing clients.

## 0.98.17

### Patch Changes

- 7bc381d: Preserve the authenticated owner context when delegated A2A agent runs are reconstructed by the processor.

## 0.98.16

### Patch Changes

- cc35446: Resolve the authenticated owner's active provider key for A2A and MCP ask-agent runs, matching the interactive chat engine path.

## 0.98.15

### Patch Changes

- 2161d10: Preserve streamed tool calls when an engine omits its normalized assistant-content event so delegated and MCP agent runs can still execute requested actions.

## 0.98.14

### Patch Changes

- 460583e: Run final-response guards even when an engine completes with streamed text but no normalized assistant-content event.

## 0.98.13

### Patch Changes

- c61d923: Keep delegated A2A and MCP agent turns explicitly bound to the authenticated owner/org scope and Act execution mode.

## 0.98.12

### Patch Changes

- 29a77ab: Keep MCP-local `ask_app` turns on the same app-level final-response guard as A2A turns.

## 0.98.11

### Patch Changes

- 3a4b613: Fall back to the portable A2A processor when a configured durable background worker rejects a task dispatch, and allow apps to explicitly opt out of stale deploy-wide background flags.
- 3a4b613: Preserve structured payloads from read-only MCP actions so external agents can inspect detailed records and replay data directly.
- 3a4b613: Preserve unset durable-background configuration and make A2A fallback dispatches reliable when the background worker is unavailable.

## 0.98.10

### Patch Changes

- 079713c: Fall back to the portable A2A processor when a configured durable background worker rejects a task dispatch, and allow apps to explicitly opt out of stale deploy-wide background flags.
- 079713c: Preserve structured payloads from read-only MCP actions so external agents can inspect detailed records and replay data directly.

## 0.98.9

### Patch Changes

- 944c202: Preserve structured payloads from read-only MCP actions so external agents can inspect detailed records and replay data directly.

## 0.98.8

### Patch Changes

- 2065b5e: Deliver integration identity notices through the durable webhook queue, fail closed for anonymous Slack direct messages unless explicitly enabled, preserve verified identity through transient re-hydration failures, redact signed object URLs from replays, and bound retryable replay upload failures.

## 0.98.7

### Patch Changes

- b94940e: Keep replay recording recoverable across transient upload failures and tab races, preserve object resources, and prevent late A2A workers from overwriting terminal task states.

## 0.98.6

### Patch Changes

- c4bb9ee: Add an opt-in authenticated-read MCP policy that automatically exposes explicitly safe GET actions while keeping external writes behind `ask_app`. Generic SQL stays out of that automatic surface.

  The `authenticatedReads: "auto"` derivation now also applies a hard, name-based exclusion for generic database (`db-query`/`db-schema`/`db-exec`/`db-patch`), template `seed-*`, extension-management, browser-session, and Context X-Ray actions, so they can never be auto-exposed even if one is mis-annotated with the full authenticated-read flag set — only an explicit `connectorCatalog` entry can expose them.

- c4bb9ee: Bound queued and processing A2A task lifetimes, preserve asynchronous dispatch semantics, and fail unrecoverable handoffs deterministically.
- c4bb9ee: Slack identity lookups no longer cache a failed users.info result for the full 10-minute TTL. Transient Slack API failures now use a short 30-second negative cache, so a brief blip cannot fail-close a sender's identity (and their DMs) for 10 minutes.
- c4bb9ee: Run verified Slack direct messages with the linked Agent-Native user's organization-scoped identity while keeping shared-channel messages service-scoped and rejecting unverified, guest, external, or cross-organization identities.

## 0.98.5

### Patch Changes

- 10dc602: Keep session replay upload backlogs within byte and event caps, and safely split server-rejected oversized batches without losing or duplicating events.
- 10dc602: Collapse completed reasoning segments into timed thought disclosures while keeping the active thought expanded.
- 10dc602: Use `anonymous@builder.io` for every email address anonymized by Demo mode.
- 10dc602: Keep long agent responses visibly active across automatic continuations, reliably follow streamed output until the user scrolls away, and default unsafe regular-function self-chaining off on hosted deployments (opt back in with `AGENT_CHAT_FOREGROUND_SELF_CHAIN`).
- 10dc602: Use Claude Haiku 4.5's supported manual thinking budget instead of sending the unsupported adaptive-thinking request.
- 10dc602: Capture framework-owned iframe content and interactions in browser session replays.
- 10dc602: Fix a durable-background chat turn dying mid-sentence with no recovery: `/runs/active` now prefers a live successor over a stale in-memory terminal run, a hung first model-stream event checkpoints within 25s instead of riding the full 90s watchdog past the foreground platform kill, and the stale-run reapers now insert a claimable recovery successor (instead of leaving the turn dead) when a background worker dies silently.
- 10dc602: Stop assigning first-party hosted app users between Sonnet and Luna so default model selection follows the normal engine configuration.
- 10dc602: Also skip demo-mode number redaction on session replay manifest requests, alongside the existing chunk/event payload skip, so replay geometry and pointer data can never be faked at view time.
- 10dc602: Fixed a bug where a long-running background agent turn could flip the chat to a finished state mid-turn: if the client re-polled a chunk's terminal run row before its server-chained successor became visible, it now keeps following instead of prematurely completing the message. Background runs that die between chunks now get a short grace window to recover onto a claimable successor before surfacing an error, and the "Resuming…" indicator stays warm while the client waits, so the UI never drops into a false-idle state during the handoff.
- 10dc602: Widen centered full-page Ask and Chat composers by 20% while keeping their responsive viewport cap.

## 0.98.4

### Patch Changes

- 1137302: Keep session replay identities isolated per browser tab so recordings from
  concurrent or duplicated tabs cannot be merged into a corrupt replay. Preserve
  signed DOM stylesheet, font, image, and other load-bearing resource URLs while
  continuing to redact navigation and diagnostic URL secrets. Recover long-lived
  tabs from replay upload identity conflicts by restarting once with a fresh
  snapshot, and report the content-free recovery outcome to Analytics.
  Stabilize Dispatch's deferred-navigation behavior under test-runner load.
- 1137302: Keep demo-mode session replay playback fast by bypassing raw event payload redaction while still anonymizing email-backed frontend identities.

## 0.98.3

### Patch Changes

- ffad302: Stop heuristically rewriting name-like text in demo mode while continuing to replace email addresses and numbers.
- ffad302: Expose lightweight settings search metadata for command palettes and other navigation surfaces.
- Updated dependencies [ffad302]
- Updated dependencies [ffad302]
  - @agent-native/toolkit@0.4.8

## 0.98.2

### Patch Changes

- dd6a05b: Expose a live client hook for reading the effective Demo mode status.
- dd6a05b: Keep local Plan verification source on-device by skipping remote renderer validation, and protect bridge credentials from hosted requests.
- dd6a05b: Allow PR Visual Recap workflows to select configurable self-hosted runners.

## 0.98.1

### Patch Changes

- ee7b5b3: Keep assistant chat's duplicate-message recovery installed when assistant-ui swaps the underlying thread runtime during reconnects or thread changes.
- ee7b5b3: Use the browser's preferred language for more accurate realtime voice transcripts.
- ee7b5b3: Prevent chat and realtime voice from starting before AI provider readiness is known, and reliably surface setup when no provider is connected.
- ee7b5b3: Update the session replay recorder to the latest stable rrweb release for more faithful browser capture.
- ee7b5b3: Skip degenerate hand-drawn frame paths that can overflow the browser call stack while a visual block is still measuring.
- ee7b5b3: Type nullable organization parameters in integration scope, budget, and workspace MCP queries so PostgreSQL can reliably prepare them.
- ee7b5b3: Prevent sync-driven request storms by preserving in-flight reads, filtering same-tab action echoes, targeting action-query invalidation, refreshing shared run state from change events, and backing idle Dispatch monitoring away from fixed polling.
- ee7b5b3: Reduce the width and height of centered full-page chat composers for a more compact starting state.
- ee7b5b3: Use dated changelog filenames when a hand-written entry omits its release date.
- ee7b5b3: Polish realtime voice settings, keep them open while using nested pickers, and add live microphone selection.
- ee7b5b3: Show the full Builder model catalog in the app default model setting instead of filtering suggestions to the current model.
- ee7b5b3: Support app-scoped encryption keys so multi-app development environments can safely read each app's encrypted data.
- ee7b5b3: Keep full-page chat open when a user navigates to Settings.
- ee7b5b3: Keep API key settings compact and move unconfigured providers and custom credentials behind a single New menu.
- ee7b5b3: Ignore expected browser autoplay-policy rejections emitted by recorded media during session replay playback.
- ee7b5b3: Let realtime voice discover and load app tools on demand while preserving guarded action execution.
- ee7b5b3: Prevent the agent prompt composer from crashing when a destroyed editor reconnects after remount or browser history restoration.
- ee7b5b3: Keep realtime voice waveforms visible between turns, show a clear connection spinner, complete the spoken ready greeting, prioritize navigation tools, flatten the orb into a translucent surface, preserve chronological voice transcripts, improve transcription language accuracy, keep popovers and the voice dock clear of the agent panel, and add in-call language, intelligence, and voice controls.
- ee7b5b3: Simplify the chat model picker to Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, and OpenRouter, with OpenRouter listed last.

## 0.98.0

### Minor Changes

- 38ca6fa: Add an opt-in projected resource load to access checks so callers that only need the access decision can skip fetching heavy resource columns. Default behavior unchanged.

  `resolveAccess()`/`assertAccess()` now accept `{ skipResourceBody: true }` (as the trailing options argument) to load only the columns the access decision itself reads — `id`, `ownerEmail`, `orgId`, `visibility` — instead of the full resource row (`resource` is typed as `AccessProjectedResource` in this mode). This is automatically ignored, falling back to a full row load, for any resource type registered with a `publicAccessRole` _function_ resolver, since that callback can read arbitrary resource fields the projection would have omitted. Passing nothing (the default) is a pure no-op: `loadResourceForAccess` still runs `db.select()` exactly as before, so none of the ~317 existing `assertAccess`/`resolveAccess` call sites change behavior.

  This is a mechanism only — no call sites are migrated in this change. `templates/design/actions/update-design.ts`'s bare `assertAccess("design", id, "editor")` — which currently pulls the full `data` blob it doesn't otherwise need — was the motivating example and is the intended first adopter as a follow-up. Note: the `"design"` resource type itself is registered with a dynamic `publicAccessRole` resolver (`publicDesignAccessRole`), which the guard above always excludes from projection, so that specific call would keep loading the full row even after opting in; `"design-system"` (checked a few lines later in the same action) has no such resolver and is a real candidate. Follow-up migration work should account for this per resource type rather than assuming every `assertAccess`/`resolveAccess` call site benefits.

### Patch Changes

- 38ca6fa: Fix realtime voice microphone selection, connection teardown, stalled sessions, and compact audio-reactive controls.
- 38ca6fa: Add an optional `agentInputSchema` to `defineAction` — a Standard Schema used ONLY to build the tool definition advertised to the model/MCP/A2A listings, while runtime validation keeps enforcing the full `schema`. Applied it in `templates/plan` to `create-visual-plan`, `create-ui-plan`, `create-plan-design`, `create-prototype-plan`, `update-visual-plan`, and `update-local-plan-folder`: their advertised `content`/`contentPatches` block shapes now show a compact `type` enum plus a pointer to `get-plan-blocks` instead of embedding the full per-block-type union, cutting each action's serialized tool definition by roughly half to three-quarters (largest actions went from ~55-58KB down to ~24-27KB; the rest from ~45-47KB down to ~13-15KB) without changing what content is accepted or how validation errors are reported.
- 38ca6fa: Default app chats to compact first-turn tool and resource catalogs, keep uncommon actions, instructions, and integrations discoverable on demand, parallelize resource summaries, and record first-request prompt and tool payload sizes in run diagnostics.
- 38ca6fa: Add optional content-free positive, negative, and neutral message sentiment tracking, enabled by default for first-party hosted apps with GPT-5.6 Luna.
- 38ca6fa: Advertise and accept the standard `offline_access` OAuth scope so ChatGPT MCP apps can retain refresh-token access without repeated sign-in.
- 38ca6fa: Removed the long-deprecated `ProductionAgentPanel` and `useProductionAgent` client exports (superseded by `AgentSidebar`/`AgentToggleButton`). No internal consumers remained.
- 38ca6fa: Track content-free positive and negative sentiment events for explicit agent response feedback, including the associated model when available.
- 38ca6fa: Render one cacheable, session-independent app shell for normal page requests and gate private UI through `AppProviders` on the client. Explicit auth pages remain cached login documents, signed-in visitors redirect without cache-buster query loops, APIs/actions remain server-protected, and generated edge workers now enforce the same anonymous public-shell cache policy as Nitro and Netlify.
- 38ca6fa: Keep React Router hydration scoped to an app's workspace mount path so index redirects and nested pages route correctly.
- 38ca6fa: Coalesce Nitro dev full-reloads so bursts of file edits trigger one server re-import instead of one per file.
- 38ca6fa: Reduce serialized tool-schema payload on background agent runs. `webhook-handler.ts` and `google-docs-poller.ts` now defer framework-added tools (integration memory, `call-agent`) behind an attached `tool-search` entry on the first request, keeping only the app's own actions visible up front — `createIntegrationsPlugin` supplies the app action names via a new `initialToolNames` option. `scheduler.ts` (`SchedulerDeps.getInitialToolNames`), `dispatcher.ts` (`TriggerDispatcherDeps.getInitialToolNames`), and `agent-teams.ts` (`AgentTeamRunConfig.initialToolNames`) gained the same opt-in filtering plumbing (tool-search attach + `filterInitialEngineTools` + `availableTools` for mid-run expansion), inactive by default so existing behavior is unchanged until a caller supplies an initial tool list.
- 38ca6fa: Reduce first-request token usage further: recurring jobs and automation triggers now defer framework-addition tools behind tool-search instead of always seeing the full registry; the MCP `ask_app` inner loop now uses the same compact initial-tool surface as interactive chat and A2A; the corpus-tools prompt (provider-api-request/provider-corpus-job/query-staged-dataset/run-code) no longer teaches tools by name that are missing from the first request's active tool set; oversized LEARNINGS.md/MEMORY.md content is capped instead of inlined in full outside lazy-context mode; and the First-Session Personalization block is now gated on the owner's persisted `personalization` flag instead of thread history, so a thread's system prompt stays byte-identical across turns 1 and 2 (fixing a prompt-cache break on every thread's second request).
- 38ca6fa: Keep realtime voice setup actions on one line, describe Builder credits as free, and prevent false setup prompts by cross-checking successful connection statuses.
- 38ca6fa: Explain browser loopback permissions and bridge lifecycle requirements when serving local Plans.
- 38ca6fa: Motion polish across shared UI: overlay primitives (tooltip, popover, select, context/menubar menus) now scale from their trigger, exit with ease-out, and respect prefers-reduced-motion; new shared easing tokens (--ease-drawer, --ease-collapse, --ease-out-strong); press feedback on the shared Button and composer send button; GPU-friendly progress fills; chat tool cells (files-changed/edit/write) animate open/closed like other disclosures.
- 38ca6fa: Add an Extensions docs shortcut and tighten the new-extension composer spacing.
- 38ca6fa: Show retryable error states when extension lists, widget installs, slot metadata, or extension history fail to load instead of presenting persisted extensions as empty or missing.
- Updated dependencies [38ca6fa]
  - @agent-native/toolkit@0.4.7

## 0.97.0

### Minor Changes

- f43d34c: Add `agent-native doctor` — a CLI command that scans an app's source for seven security-critical code-safety guards (unscoped credentials, unscoped queries against ownable tables, `process.env` credential reads, raw-DB tool table scoping, `process.env` mutation, `local@localhost` identity fallback, and `drizzle-kit push` in build/deploy scripts). Configurable via an optional `"doctor"` key in `agent-native.json`. `agent-native build` now runs doctor as a warn-only pre-step by default; pass `--strict` or set `agent-native.json`'s `doctor.failOnBuild: true` to make findings fail the build. The scaffolded app gets a `pnpm doctor` script and a `self-modifying-code` skill update recommending it after source edits.
- f43d34c: Added export-audit-events action (CSV/NDJSON, scoped, capped) to the audit log.
- f43d34c: Use Builder Connect and metered Builder credits automatically for realtime voice, with an OpenAI API key as the secondary fallback.
- f43d34c: Add a safe manifest-driven package lifecycle CLI with Scheduling as the first inspectable, installable, and ejectable package.

### Patch Changes

- f43d34c: Run a sticky 80/20 Sonnet 5 versus GPT-5.6 Luna default-model experiment across first-party hosted templates while preserving explicit model choices.
- f43d34c: Add a shared, presentational `ChatHistoryList` component (`@agent-native/core/client`) for rendering chat/run history lists with optional grouped sections, active-item highlight, search box, loading/empty/error states, and optional pin/rename/delete row actions. Core's `HistoryPopover` now renders through it instead of bespoke row markup, with no behavior change.
- f43d34c: Allow app final-response guards to grant models additional bounded corrective attempts before emitting a fallback.
- f43d34c: Improve Slack agent progress and diagnostics, and continue long-running delegated tasks reliably.
- f43d34c: Keep page-level chat actions clear of conversation content and expose scroll state so hosts can fade older messages beneath header controls.
- f43d34c: Reduce the public SSR edge-cache freshness window from one hour to ten minutes while retaining long stale-while-revalidate coverage.
- f43d34c: Attach a pending approval key to the Agent-Native Code tool-call transcript item so the shared inline `ApprovalAffordance` (Approve/Deny) can render directly under the paused bash call, instead of only through a separate host banner. `ApprovalContext` gains optional `onDeny` and `onAlwaysAllow` hooks (both additive; existing consumers keep today's Approve-only, local-Deny behavior when they don't supply them), and `AssistantChat` accepts an optional `approvalActions` prop to wire them. `createCodeAgentChatAdapter` now resolves an approved Code tool call through `controller.control("approve")` instead of treating the approval message as a new prompt.
- f43d34c: Protect state-changing framework routes from CSRF when the app is mounted under an APP_BASE_PATH.
- f43d34c: Export `./styles/agent-conversation.css` from the package so consumers outside the monorepo (like the desktop app) can import it by package specifier instead of a fragile source-relative path.
- f43d34c: Export `./styles/chat-history-list.css` from the package so non-Tailwind hosts (like `@agent-native/code-agents-ui`) can import the shared `ChatHistoryList` stylesheet by package specifier instead of a fragile source-relative path.
- f43d34c: Reconcile stale runs in parallel when listing thread runs instead of sequentially.
- f43d34c: Scope durable sync-event reads in /poll to the requesting user/org so the existing owner/org indexes are used.
- f43d34c: Make app-secret writes an atomic upsert and org membership acceptance idempotent (unique org member index + conflict-safe insert).
- f43d34c: Document the built-in durable background sandbox queue and its execution and
  isolation boundaries across all supported docs locales.
- f43d34c: Fail closed on internal self-dispatch processor routes when no A2A_SECRET is configured and the runtime is not provably local (previously an unrecognized deployed host with no secret ran these routes unauthenticated).
- f43d34c: Export the reasoning hook from browser-only SSR stubs so Cloudflare template builds remain deployable.
- f43d34c: Archived chat threads are now excluded from thread lists and search by default, so archiving a thread actually removes it from the sidebar/history and the `chat-history` agent tool. Pass `includeArchived: true` (store options, `chat-history` search action, or `search-chats` script) to see archived threads explicitly.
- f43d34c: Use one primary composer action while a response is running: show stop for an empty draft, restore send when the user types, and keep the microphone immediately to its left.
- f43d34c: Removed the never-implemented deterministic automations mode — the manage-automations schema now offers agentic only, and legacy deterministic values are rejected at define time instead of silently never firing.
- f43d34c: Preserve template and use-case context in Builder waitlist form submissions and lifecycle events.
- f43d34c: Reject cross-site browser requests before creating realtime voice sessions or executing realtime voice tools.
- f43d34c: Select composer context chips with the first Backspace at the start of a prompt, then remove the selected chip with the next Backspace.
- f43d34c: Show compact GPT-5.6 model and reasoning names in the collapsed chat composer control.
- f43d34c: Add a structured `signal: "credential-gap"` marker to code-agent transcript events and export a shared `isCredentialGapCodeAgentEvent` helper so history builders (`thread-data-builder.ts`, `code-agent-transcript.ts`) detect the "no LLM provider key" condition from the executor's structured field instead of regex-matching the hint text. The regex remains only as a fallback for already-persisted transcripts that predate the field.

### Patch Changes

- 48d8471: Keep Slack agent task cards active through deferred cross-agent work, show durable progress, and deliver the true final result instead of treating interim artifacts as complete.
- 48d8471: Keep completed realtime voice turns in their originating chat, restore that chat safely when voice ends, and expose live audio activity to the voice dock.

## 0.94.0

### Minor Changes

- dfbbf30: Add scoped relay primitives for computer-capable devices, typed leased operations, durable approvals, replay protection, handle-only live-view events, and bounded binary-safe relay payloads.
- dfbbf30: Add framework-wide OpenAI Realtime voice conversations with shared agent tools, actions, and navigation.
- dfbbf30: Add owner-scoped follow-up, approval, denial, resume, and stop lifecycle controls for agent harness sessions.

### Patch Changes

- dfbbf30: Reduce idle hosted request volume by relaxing database sync polling between agent runs, waking event-driven application-state readers only when their values change, and avoiding duplicate action-query invalidation waves.
- dfbbf30: Keep controlled settings pages in sync with organization hash links.
- dfbbf30: Agent chat now uses Medium reasoning by default across supported models, migrates legacy Auto selections to Medium, avoids duplicate generic running status while reasoning streams, and renders completed reasoning directly inside the shared work summary.
- dfbbf30: Allow explicitly marked Agent-Native desktop child runs to receive their authenticated loopback computer-control MCP server without replacing user MCP configuration.
- dfbbf30: Keep the optional server tokenizer out of browser production bundles, publish Dispatch's Operations route, simplify Dispatch's sidebar identity and chat history, and route design-task creation into structured intake.

## 0.93.0

### Minor Changes

- d967304: Add managed multi-workspace Slack OAuth with Agent view and direct messages, team-aware threads, bounded native context, streaming task controls, channel identities, explicit memory, channel routines, and usage governance.
- d967304: Add verified Microsoft Teams and Discord interaction channel adapters, preserve Telegram topic and WhatsApp contextual-reply identity, and expose exact runtime capabilities in Dispatch setup.

### Patch Changes

- d967304: Add Clay's Public API as a constrained provider preset with official API-key authentication, documentation discovery, and hosted-agent guidance.
- d967304: Add a safe, provider-neutral automation workflow runtime with explicit n8n support metadata and honest Zapier blueprint guidance.
- d967304: Remove outline-like shadows from shared app and agent main surfaces for a consistently borderless shell.
- d967304: Allow host apps to observe active shared-composer text and render contextual content above the composer.
- d967304: Back off browser speech-recognition retries after network failures, and let authenticated app workers reuse the durable Netlify background runtime.
- d967304: Clarify in docs and agent routing that extensions render on their own pages or in named slots, while deeper host UI customization should continue through the Builder.io Cloud Agent or local source editing flow.
- d967304: Allow resumable file-upload providers to clean up aborted upload sessions.
- d967304: Exclude local databases and generated visual plan previews from newly scaffolded apps.
- d967304: Keep unconnected chat composers stable with an accessible, icon-free AI connection popover.
- d967304: Point Figma provider API discovery at the current official documentation and explain required scopes and canvas-write limitations.
- d967304: Render horizontal grid lines in OG images with the same spacing and styling as the vertical lines.
- d967304: Route opted-in async A2A tasks through Netlify's durable background worker so long analytics queries are not killed by the foreground function timeout.
- d967304: Avoid false stuck warnings while a durable worker is alive inside its bounded tool window, make retries wait for the prior run to be durably aborted, and keep concurrent progress updates from moving the displayed no-progress clock backward.
- d967304: Fix a race where a background chat run silently deferred for sweep-based recovery could hit the client's idle timeout before the server redispatched it, surfacing a false "run stopped" error instead of resuming quietly. Queued follow-ups now reattach to the recovering run instead of colliding with it, and terminal continuation conflicts settle pending activity cards so completed or failed chats never retain a working spinner.
- d967304: Allow the Design local-file bridge to edit existing safe text and code files without relying on a narrow extension allowlist, while continuing to block secrets and binary files.
- d967304: Apply app final-response guards to delegated A2A turns and resolve Slack sender profiles with request-scoped configured credentials.
- d967304: Allow design-system indexing callers to fail loudly when inline files exceed size or count limits instead of silently dropping them.
- d967304: Stop the stuck-run banner's Retry button from aborting a run that still has a live tool call or sub-agent (A2A) `call agent` in flight — a slow provider query or cross-app call can legitimately go minutes without emitting progress, and Retry previously killed that work and re-executed it from scratch. When `AssistantChat`'s new `hasInFlightWork()` reports live work, `RunStuckBanner` hides Retry and offers only an explicit, clearly-labeled Cancel; auto-retry is likewise suppressed. `MultiTabAssistantChat` wires this through automatically.
- d967304: Scope shared workspace resources and learnings to the active organization, load them for queued Slack and integration turns, and preserve legacy app-wide resources as inherited defaults.
- d967304: Fix a false `stale_run` failure for background runs holding a long tool call or A2A `call-agent` delegation: the stale-run reaper now grants a bounded grace to a run whose in-flight work is provably still open, even when its heartbeat write itself failed, instead of killing it on a single missed heartbeat window. A genuinely dead run with stuck in-flight work is still failed loudly once the bounded grace elapses. `/runs/active` also now surfaces this signal as `hasInFlightWork` so clients can tell a run with live work apart from one that is truly stuck.
- d967304: Make Desktop's New action prompt-first: a coding agent now builds and registers local Agent-Native apps, remembers the preferred apps folder, starts managed dev servers when opened, keeps the app's sidebar coding tools available for explicitly marked local Desktop previews, and adds native sidebar tab editing, removal, and reordering.
- d967304: Keep local development auto-login credentials out of terminal output while preserving zero-setup sign-in.
- d967304: Keep authenticated local Design preview sessions shared across URL-backed screens and proxy same-origin app mutations safely.
- d967304: Preserve canonical Slack and Telegram request context across A2A delegation, resolve structured intake and domain workflows through workspace instructions and app capabilities, and return verified destination links for saved Content records, Analytics monitors, and published Forms.
- d967304: Redact provider request audit targets and harden managed integration persistence against concurrent callbacks and database migration failures.
- d967304: Harden integration tenant isolation, service-principal identity, shared job routing, audit visibility, and usage-budget settlement.
- d967304: Add a shared integration catalog with accurate built-in messaging metadata and reusable client helpers for integration setup routes.
- d967304: Surface real remote liveness during cross-app agent calls (call-agent): while the A2A poll waits on another app, each successful poll that reports the remote still working now keeps progress moving, so a slow-but-healthy sub-agent no longer triggers a false "no progress" stuck warning whose Retry button aborts the healthy call and re-runs it from scratch. A hung or unresponsive remote still emits nothing, so the stuck warning correctly appears.
- d967304: Keep in-memory run aborts successful when durable abort cleanup temporarily fails.

## 0.92.12

### Patch Changes

- 1ecce26: Surface missing LLM credentials and earlier stream errors as failed agent runs instead of successful completions.

## 0.92.11

### Patch Changes

- 4552931: Keep local React visual-edit previews hydrated by preserving Vite request metadata and response lengths through the bridge, and recover exact development source locations from React jsxDEV Fiber stacks.
- 4552931: Expose strict active-collaboration awareness reads so safety-critical sync flows can distinguish no open editor from presence-storage failures.
- 4552931: Add cancellation-safe `sendToAgentChatAndConfirm` delivery confirmation and its submit-result event contract so callers can preserve user work when a local chat message is rejected or times out, without allowing that timed-out message to arrive later.
- 4552931: Fix `.fig` and other binary files silently corrupting when uploaded through `index-design-system-with-builder`: `buildBuilderDesignSystemIndexFiles` always UTF-8-encoded file content even though `mimeTypeForBuilderDesignSystemFilename` already recognized `.fig` as binary (`application/octet-stream`). Add an optional per-file `encoding: "utf8" | "base64"` (defaults to `utf8`, unchanged for existing text-file callers) so binary files can be base64-encoded by the caller and decoded byte-exact here.
- 4552931: Prevent pre-seed collaborative editor updates from reaching autosave, and allow newer authoritative restores to reapply content previously emitted during mount while retaining stale-echo protection during active typing.
- 4552931: Prevent PR recap workflows from publishing screenshots of failed recap pages, and report SSR render failures through configured error monitoring.
- 4552931: Fix long agent-chat turns dying with a Netlify "508 Loop Detected" error after several server-driven continuation chunks: nested self-dispatch chains now break proactively before the platform's undocumented loop-protection limit, and a 508 that does occur is classified distinctly and deferred to the existing unclaimed-run sweep for recovery instead of failing the turn outright.
- 4552931: Recover background chat turns whose continuation handoff dispatch failed instead of failing them immediately: the pre-inserted successor run is left claimable so the unclaimed-run sweep can redispatch it (and the client poll defers to that sweep within a bound), backed by a backstop that still fails loud if the handoff never lands.

  Operational note — terminal-reason change: when a continuation handoff exhausts its dispatch retry budget but the successor row exists, the run's `terminal_reason` is now `background_continuation_dispatch_deferred` (recoverable, awaiting sweep redispatch) instead of `background_continuation_dispatch_failed`. The old `background_continuation_dispatch_failed` reason is still emitted, but now only in the narrower case where the successor row itself could not be pre-inserted. Any dashboards, alerts, or audit queries matching `background_continuation_dispatch_failed` should add `background_continuation_dispatch_deferred` to keep covering this failure class.

- 4552931: Fix an awareness "storm" in `useCollaborativeDoc`: the shared collab connection's fast awareness-push path re-broadcast a client's own (unchanged) presence state whenever ANY remote participant's awareness changed, not just when the local user actually moved their cursor or updated their presence. With several people collaborating on the same document, every peer's cursor move caused every other connected client to also re-POST its own state, multiplying awareness traffic roughly quadratically with participant count. The fast-push listener now only fires on locally-originated awareness changes (`origin === "local"`), matching the equivalent guard already present in `usePresence`.

  Also add a defensive size cap to the collab `recentEdits` ring (`appendRecentEdit`): descriptor strings (`quote`, `selector`, path entries) and the edit `label` are now truncated to 500 characters. The ring was already bounded in length, but an app forgetting to trim its own excerpt before publishing (e.g. passing a whole paragraph or document as `quote`) could otherwise push an oversized payload through the awareness fast-path broadcast and into the `_collab_awareness` SQL mirror.

- 4552931: Give the Design localhost bridge a per-boot `bridgeInstanceId`, exposed on `/health`, the `/live-edit-bridge` registration response, and the `/live-edit` "unknown bridge key" 409 (now carrying a machine-readable `code: "unknown-bridge-key"` and the echoed `bridgeKey`). This lets a client distinguish a bridge process restart — which silently empties the in-memory live-edit bridge script registry — from a genuine registration bug, instead of guessing from free-text error strings.
- 4552931: Fix a recurring `DataCloneError` console error when any embedded extension (Design's Tools/Extensions panel, or any other app using `EmbeddedExtension`) loads or its slot context updates. Slot contexts commonly carry live callback functions the host uses internally; `postMessage`'s structured clone algorithm throws on function-valued properties, so the context update silently never reached the extension iframe. Sanitize the context through a JSON round-trip (dropping functions) before posting it.
- 4552931: Harden local Design source writes with SHA-256 version checks, per-file serialization, atomic replacement, and repeated symlink containment validation.

## 0.92.10

### Patch Changes

- 22abd76: Prevent Netlify, Vercel, and AWS Lambda deployments from failing SSR requests when collaboration runtime chunks import Yjs.

## 0.92.9

### Patch Changes

- d5d94f2: Prevent PR recap workflows from publishing screenshots of failed recap pages, and report SSR render failures through configured error monitoring.

## 0.92.8

### Patch Changes

- 02ff384: Keep Design localhost route manifests, collision-resistant route identities, and per-screen live-edit bridge scripts stable across reconnects and multi-screen editing. Split read-only preview authorization from filesystem access, require authenticated preview endpoints, and restrict bridge CORS to approved Design origins.
- 02ff384: Prevent local template dev servers from discovering editor dependencies after startup and reloading with outdated optimized modules. Keep production SSR builds on one shared Yjs implementation so collaboration types retain constructor identity.
- 02ff384: Add a budget-coordinated keepalive action helper for reliable unload-time writes.
- 02ff384: Replace the managed and BYOK GPT model catalogs with GPT-5.6 Sol, Terra, and Luna.
- 02ff384: Preserve prior continuation tool results when final-response guards validate a multi-chunk agent turn, recover failed durable handoffs through the client continuation path, and retain completed-side-effect metadata for journal-recovered writes. Successful data queries and dashboard mutations are no longer reported as missing after a background boundary.
- 02ff384: Keep hosted database runtime detection type-safe when core database helpers are compiled inside template applications.
- 02ff384: Fix a bug where a durable-background agent run could be killed by a single transient network blip during its soft-timeout chunk handoff. A worker proven to be running inside a real background function now gets a retry budget sized for its remaining wall-clock time (5 attempts / 15s timeout) instead of being silently demoted to the smaller foreground budget just because it was forced onto the same-process dispatch target.

## 0.92.7

### Patch Changes

- 37f3367: Preserve starter-pinned `@agent-native/toolkit` versions during builder-agent-native-starter manifest sync so template sync does not reset the update bot's exact toolkit pin back to `"latest"`.

## 0.92.6

### Patch Changes

- 5f187db: Highlight run-code source snippets in chat and keep raw tool output popovers within the available viewport.
- 5f187db: Fix duplicate in-progress chat output during reconnect handoff so streaming text and tool calls render once while the live assistant message catches up. Also stop a reconnect tool spinner from rendering a second card beside its live pending tool card when their reader-local and server-scoped ids don't match, in every reconnect/handoff window.
- 5f187db: Focus the settings search field automatically when desktop users open settings.
- 5f187db: Improve organization settings so invites stay above the fold and members appear in a separate table card.
- 6a29ba0: `ssrfSafeFetch` hardening: a new `httpsOnly` option validates the URL scheme on the initial request and on every redirect hop, so HTTPS-only callers cannot be downgraded to plain HTTP by a redirect from the untrusted origin. Followed redirect responses now also have their bodies cancelled so each hop's connection is released immediately instead of being held until GC.
- 5f187db: Remove the divider between settings tabs and their tab content.
- 5f187db: Preserve dashboard, chart, and label names in demo mode while continuing to anonymize free-text/contact names, emails, and numbers.
- c32c174: add preset-driven-flow to asset template docs

## 0.92.5

### Patch Changes

- eed1710: Fix `/visual-edit` live-edit 401s. The design server now mints the bridge token in `connect-localhost` and returns it from `open-visual-edit`, and `design connect` adopts it via a new `--bridge-token` flag (or `AGENT_NATIVE_BRIDGE_TOKEN`) instead of minting its own. The local bridge and the user's connection row now share the secret without the CLI needing its own auth to self-register — which was impossible under OAuth-based MCP and was the root cause of the 401s. The `visual-edit` skill is updated to call `open-visual-edit` first and start the bridge with the returned token.

## 0.92.4

### Patch Changes

- 86697e9: Depend on `@agent-native/toolkit` via `workspace:^` instead of `workspace:*`. Publishing now pins a caret range (e.g. `^0.4.3`) rather than an exact version, so an app that scaffolds `@agent-native/toolkit@latest` separately can dedupe against it through normal semver resolution instead of installing two mismatched toolkit copies side by side (which crashed Vite with `"./collab-ui" is not exported`).

## 0.92.3

### Patch Changes

- 0fee97b: Animate settings section cards open and closed with intrinsic height transitions.
- 0fee97b: Document how to build API-only Agent-Native apps with actions on the built-in Nitro/H3 server.
- 0fee97b: Replay the real terminal error for completed agent runs on reconnect instead of replacing provider failures with stale-run messages, and stop heartbeat updates after a run leaves the running state.
- 0fee97b: Allow signed embed sessions for Analytics dashboard deep links to authenticate after canonical `/dashboards/:id` redirects.
- 0fee97b: Prevent stale stored awareness rows from resurrecting user or agent presence after a client explicitly leaves a collaborative document.
- 0fee97b: Abort superseded chat reconnect readers and back off failed reattach attempts so repeated stale runs do not create client request storms.
- 0fee97b: Harden chat stop and queued follow-up handling so interrupted tool calls settle cleanly, and flush Agent-Native analytics immediately in serverless runtimes.
- 0fee97b: Avoid CORS preflight storms for embedded framework polling by using query-token auth on safe `/_agent-native` GET requests.
- 0fee97b: Deliver Agent-Native Analytics tracking immediately in serverless runtimes so `http.response` health telemetry is not lost after the response finishes.
- 0fee97b: Prevent in-flight tool call cards from flickering between newer and older states during reconnect, thread import, and retry clears.
- 0fee97b: Make chat prompt submission update immediately and make Stop clear queued follow-ups and settle interrupted tool calls.
- 0fee97b: Single-flight the agent run heartbeat write so a run holds at most one Neon connection for liveness. The 1.5s heartbeat timer previously fired a fresh write every tick regardless of whether the prior one was still in flight; under Neon pooler saturation (writes taking up to the ~8s DB timeout) this piled up ~5 concurrent heartbeat connections per run, adding to the connection-cap exhaustion that starves the heartbeat and gets the still-alive run false-reaped as stale. The abort and no-progress-backstop checks still run every tick.
- 0fee97b: Normalize unsupported saved agent models to a supported version match or the engine default.
- 0fee97b: Remove Grok Code Fast and Qwen3 Coder from the Builder gateway model picker.
- 0fee97b: Treat Anthropic/Builder bare "Connection error." failures as retryable network interruptions, and stop mislabeling those failed runs as stale_run when the client reconnects past the real terminal event.
- 0fee97b: Stop `useDbSync` from turning app-state navigation/selection churn into a client fetch storm. `app-state` change events (agent/UI navigation, selection, and the set-url/questions command channel) now only invalidate their own `["app-state"]` and command query keys — they no longer fan out into the broad `["action"]`, `["extension"]`, and `["tool"]` data-query invalidation. Only events that can actually change action/extension-backed data (action mutations, settings, extensions, collab, screen-refresh) refetch those prefixes.

  During an active agent session the app mirrors navigation and selection into `application_state` continuously, and on serverless the poll fallback replays those writes back to the originating tab (the DB-scan path can't preserve `requestSource`, so `ignoreSource` can't filter them). Each replayed write previously refetched every action query at once, and that request storm exhausted the DB connection pool — which starved run heartbeat writes and surfaced downstream as `stale_run` chat errors. Real mutations that also write navigation state still refresh action queries because their `action` event rides in the same batch.

- 0fee97b: Show streamed agent reasoning when gateways emit AI SDK-style reasoning deltas.
- 0fee97b: Show raw tool call output in an auto-height popover with viewport-capped scrolling instead of a fixed-height dialog.

## 0.92.2

## 0.92.1

- 1d13434: Allow extension iframes to trigger user-initiated downloads and add CSV export to standard data table widgets.
- 1d13434: Remove the GitHub icon from the free and open source badge on public booking pages.
- 1d13434: Make framework polling cheaper with durable sync events, remove Dispatch's short app-list polling intervals, preview large DB admin cells by default to avoid accidental blob transfers, and require configured file storage for binary resource uploads instead of storing base64 blobs in SQL.
- 1d13434: Stage database-admin table selections as agent chat context chips and selected-object application state so users can ask the agent about the active table.
- 1d13434: Show a clear unavailable state for shared extension links that the viewer cannot access, instead of leaving the standalone extension page looking blank.
- 1d13434: Filter known browser and extension noise from first-party error auto-capture while preserving real app fetch failures.
- 1d13434: Recover stale background chat runs instead of surfacing them as terminal failures, and keep chat handoffs from restoring stale server snapshots over fresher completed replies.
- 1d13434: Fix durable polling cursors, DB admin large-cell safeguards, extension unavailable states, and stale chat snapshot handling.
- 1d13434: Show organization access controls alongside long team member lists when the Team settings surface has enough width.

## 0.92.0

### Minor Changes

- 680b1eb: Show plain-English thinking in chat, Codex-style tool rows with modal output, and collapse finished work into a "Worked for" summary.
- 680b1eb: Add `agent-native upgrade` (with `upgrade check` doctor) so older apps can bump `@agent-native/*`, refresh scaffold skills, and verify without inventing core/dispatch patches or overrides. Harden self-modifying-code / AGENTS guidance, discover workspace packages from `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, and ship the `upgrade-agent-native` skill.

### Patch Changes

- 680b1eb: Keep plan-mode blocked tools visible and discoverable as blocked stubs, preload common provider tools in lean agent runs, steer extension edits away from repeated large content scans, and let raw JSON Schema tool inputs recover from common scalar string values without poisoning read-only duplicate caches.
- 680b1eb: Compact repeated tool-search results and unchanged extension content within a single agent run to preserve context, while keeping schema-including tool searches repeatable when the agent explicitly asks for schemas.
- 680b1eb: Always register Slack/webhook/email notification channels, prefer delivery-only per-notification webhook URLs, and avoid applying workspace auth headers to override destinations.
- 680b1eb: Stop rewriting session-replay Meta and ViewportResize dimensions at capture so stored frames stay aligned with the FullSnapshot DOM, while display sizing still clamps extreme aspect ratios.
- 680b1eb: Render Agent settings sections as polished card surfaces on full settings pages while keeping the sidebar settings panel compact.
- Updated dependencies [680b1eb]
  - @agent-native/toolkit@0.4.4

## 0.91.2

### Patch Changes

- 823d635: Add a friendly label for the Calendar `calendar.event-detail.bottom` ExtensionSlot so the empty-slot affordance matches Mail's contact sidebar pattern.
- 823d635: Surface outbound delivery-queue health on Destinations and add quiet overview shortcuts so cleaned-up overview capabilities stay discoverable without restoring the old dashboard. Localize those overview shortcut and delivery-queue labels across Dispatch locales.
- 823d635: Attribute recurring job and automation LLM usage to task-specific usage labels.
- 823d635: Clamp absurd session-replay Meta and ViewportResize dimensions at capture so ultra-wide frames are never stored.
- 823d635: Align run-slot liveness with the stale reaper and surface repeated heartbeat write failures.
- 823d635: Upgrade the workspace toolchain to TypeScript 7 (`tsc`) with a side-by-side TypeScript 6 API package for tools that still need programmatic access. Replace `@typescript/native-preview` / `tsgo` with the stable `typescript` 7 release.
- Updated dependencies [823d635]
- Updated dependencies [823d635]
  - @agent-native/toolkit@0.4.3

## 0.91.1

### Patch Changes

- 942165f: Fix design live-edit preview showing a 404/NotFound for client-side-routed
  (SPA) dev apps. The bridge served every snapshot from its own `/live-edit`
  path, so the proxied app's router booted at `location.pathname === "/live-edit"`
  and matched no route. The bridge now injects a synchronous pre-boot
  `history.replaceState` shim that rewrites the iframe path to the real target
  route before the app bundle runs. Asset resolution (via the injected
  `<base href>`) is unchanged, and static/non-SPA apps are unaffected.

## 0.91.0

### Minor Changes

- e310ac1: Add first-party, Sentry-style error capture to the analytics client SDK. `configureTracking({ errorCapture })` now auto-captures uncaught exceptions (`window.onerror`) and unhandled promise rejections, exposes a manual `captureException(error, context?)` / `captureMessage(message, level?)` API plus `addErrorBreadcrumb`, and ties each captured exception to the active session replay id so errors link straight to the recording they happened in. Captured exceptions are sent through the existing first-party analytics ingest as a dedicated `$exception` event and are redacted + deduped client-side. Additive and backward-compatible; error capture only installs when a public key is configured (or explicitly enabled).
- e310ac1: Revamp the shared settings shell (`SettingsTabsPage`): an edge-aligned,
  independently scrolling left nav with consistent theming, a built-in settings
  search that deep-links into tabs and sections via `searchEntries` /
  `generalSearchEntries`, and a new controlled `value` / `onValueChange` mode so
  apps can drive the active tab from their own routing and application state.
- e310ac1: Make agent-native chat threads shareable through the framework share dialog so collaborators can view or edit shared chats.

### Patch Changes

- e310ac1: Populate in-app "What's new" surfaces from pending app changelog entries during dev and build.
- e310ac1: Use shadcn's message scroller primitives for core chat transcripts so streaming replies, turn anchoring, and scroll-to-bottom behavior stay smoother in long or dynamically resizing chats.
- e310ac1: Auto-continue recoverable chat run timeouts during reconnect without showing the internal resume prompt in chat history, and retry transient `ask_app_status` bridge fetch failures before surfacing an error.
- e310ac1: Recover Google popup sign-in pages when the session cookie is present but the parent page misses the automatic OAuth exchange redirect.
- e310ac1: Hide internal share principal ids in share dialogs by resolving organization names and using safe fallback labels.
- e310ac1: Fix Vite dev server resolution for Agent-Native templates that load local or transitive `@agent-native/toolkit` subpath exports.
- e310ac1: Avoid repeated Sentry reports when workspace dev app discovery hits local filesystem permission errors.

## 0.90.11

### Patch Changes

- bba7332: Keep agent-chat workers on the hosted foreground timeout unless they are actually running inside a background function, preventing misrouted workers from being killed as stale runs.
- bba7332: Fix "The model returned an empty response" on hard/long-context chat turns: interactive chat now resolves max_output_tokens to min(model ceiling, 32K) instead of the flat 4096-8192 per-engine defaults, Anthropic/Gemini numeric thinking budgets are clamped to always leave real output headroom under max_tokens, and the empty-final-response retry now raises the token ceiling and steps reasoning effort down a tier (with the retry budget raised from 1 to 2 attempts) instead of re-issuing the identical doomed request.
- bba7332: Stop misrouted agent-chat workers from taking the large background Neon connection pool. `isBackgroundFunctionPoolContext()` no longer trusts the dispatch marker (`__AGENT_NATIVE_BACKGROUND_RUNTIME_EXPECTED__`) — a worker dispatched toward a `-background` URL but routed onto the ~60s synchronous function would otherwise open the 8-connection worker pool while running as one of many warm sync-function instances, exhausting the Neon pooled endpoint (connection terminated / statement timeouts / failed heartbeat writes surfacing as stale runs). Only the genuine `-background` runtime marker (set at cold start) unlocks the larger pool now, mirroring the same proof-of-landing tightening applied to the worker soft-timeout.

## 0.90.10

### Patch Changes

- d6153fd: Remove extra root padding from borderless wireframe blocks and tighten the Toolkit docs hero wireframe header.
- d6153fd: Retry reasoning-only empty agent responses once before surfacing the manual retry message.
- d6153fd: Fix Netlify single-template deploy previews by keeping Nitro's `preferStatic` true (so `/assets/*` is served from `dist`) and stripping the harmful default-function URL rewrite that is incompatible with `config.path: "/*"`.
- d6153fd: Enable first-party session replay by default for signed-in hosted users when Agent-Native Analytics is configured, while preserving explicit replay opt-outs.
- d6153fd: Let Builder video uploads request stable URLs while allowing asynchronous compression, so Clips can keep a single media URL without disabling compression.

## 0.90.9

### Patch Changes

- a1db610: Fix Netlify single-template deploy previews by keeping Nitro's `preferStatic` true (so `/assets/*` is served from `dist`) and stripping the harmful default-function URL rewrite that is incompatible with `config.path: "/*"`.

## 0.90.8

### Patch Changes

- 1de8510: Allow public Builder waitlist signups to submit an explicit email address for docs build-online CTAs.
- 1de8510: Emit and require a Netlify fallback redirect so single-template deploys route dynamic app requests to the server function instead of publishing platform 404s.

## 0.90.7

### Patch Changes

- 3c7adac: Allow public Builder waitlist signups to submit an explicit email address for docs build-online CTAs.
- 3c7adac: Fail Netlify builds when the generated output is missing the catch-all server function needed to serve the app.

## 0.90.6

### Patch Changes

- f6ecee2: Stop unnecessary re-renders driven by collaborative-doc awareness traffic and coalesce SSE-driven query invalidation. `useCollaborativeDoc`'s `activeUsers`/`agentPresent` now only produce a new identity when the deduped active-user set actually changes, instead of on every awareness broadcast (cursor jiggles, unchanged re-published presence state); `useDbSync` batches SSE/poll-driven `invalidateQueries` calls into at most one flush per 250ms instead of one per event. Interaction-critical events (agent navigation, `__set_url__`, and guided questions app-state writes) bypass the coalesce window and flush immediately, so agent-driven navigation and prompts are never delayed by batching.

## 0.90.5

### Patch Changes

- 3da78df: Classify BYO-provider rate limits (HTTP 429) as retryable. The native Anthropic and AI-SDK engines now forward the provider HTTP status as a structured `http_<status>` errorCode + `statusCode` for every failure (not just 401), so a bare "429 status code (no body)" surfaces as `http_429`. `isRetryableError` also matches `http_429` and bare `429` messages. Previously a directly-connected provider key that Anthropic rate-limited failed hard instead of backing off and retrying like the Builder gateway path does, and rate-limited runs can now auto-continue.
- 3da78df: Fix localhost Design bridge self-registration so capability payloads match the Design server action and bridge tokens can be persisted.
- 3da78df: Make hosted foreground agent turns continue from the server by default, so switching tabs or closing the browser no longer leaves long runs dependent on a client-side auto-continue POST.

## 0.90.4

### Patch Changes

- 9f396bc: Fail closed for unregistered History/Review resource types, allocate unique version numbers atomically, verify resolve/consume update counts, and prefer server snapshots over client-supplied ones.
- 9f396bc: Add live visual-edit bridge support for localhost apps so Design can render editable live iframes instead of static HTML snapshots.
- 9f396bc: Expire sticky provider auth-failure markers, skip rejected deploy env keys during engine auto-detect, and clear failure markers from the legacy save-key path.
- 9f396bc: Keep React Router build packages installed for scaffolded app builds and report missing build dependencies before spawning the CLI.

## 0.90.3

### Patch Changes

- ec523c4: Allow Builder transcription callers to override the request timeout so long-running media workflows can avoid premature aborts.
- ec523c4: Skip saved model provider keys after auth failures so chats can fall back to Builder credentials instead of repeatedly retrying rejected BYO keys.
- ec523c4: Add a Builder upload option for internal recording artifacts to skip asset-library registration.
- ec523c4: Show the current sharing visibility icon directly in shared ShareButton triggers and use the users-group glyph for organization visibility.
- ec523c4: Add first-class Toolkit docs plus reusable History, Comments/Review, Org/Team, Setup/Connections, and Command/Navigation kit primitives.
- Updated dependencies [ec523c4]
  - @agent-native/toolkit@0.4.2

## 0.90.2

### Patch Changes

- 74d3e5a: Prevent client fetch storms during high-volume background mutations: `useActionMutation` accepts `skipActionQueryInvalidation` so background mutations can perform narrow invalidation instead of refetching every action query, `useDbSync` accepts `suppressActionInvalidationFor` to skip whole-action-cache invalidation for named high-volume action sync events, and action-query retries are bounded to one attempt for network-level failures (Chrome reports connection-pool exhaustion as a generic fetch failure, so unbounded retries sustained the storm).
- 16f7429: Defer collaborative rich-markdown seed writes to a timer task so initial Y.Doc seeding does not call `setContent` from React lifecycle.
- 254f061: Defer agent-authored URL navigation out of React effects to avoid lifecycle flushSync warnings.
- 69e1e38: Defer collaborative awareness presence updates so editor creation does not trigger React render-time state warnings.
- 8976a28: Log framework route failures with route, status, message, and development stacks before returning JSON errors.
- d61ca0c: The collaborative reconcile applies external content on a timer task instead of a microtask, so `setContent` can no longer run inside a React lifecycle flush ("flushSync was called from inside a lifecycle method" console errors during collab reconciliation).
- 66ffcd9: Treat client-aborted framework route requests as disconnects instead of logging and returning 500 errors.
- a74a885: `useDbSync` batches consisting entirely of suppressed action events (via `suppressActionInvalidationFor`) now skip the fixed framework invalidation list (extension, slot, tool, and app-state keys) as well as the whole-action-cache invalidation — high-volume background mutations no longer refetch framework queries on every poll tick. Events are still forwarded to `onEvent` and per-source change versions still bump.
- d44ad4e: Concurrent top-level async transactions are serialized per connection. Previously a transaction starting while another was open saw `inTransaction` and opened a savepoint inside the other task's transaction, which then committed out from under it ("no such savepoint" 500s under concurrent reads/writes). Same-task nesting is detected via AsyncLocalStorage and keeps the direct savepoint path.

## 0.90.1

### Patch Changes

- 2054fed: Fix Cloudflare Pages deploys that import the Node console builtin.

## 0.90.0

### Minor Changes

- e1ad535: Add the data-programs primitive: named, stored, agent-authored JS scripts executed server-side through the existing run-code sandbox, with a SQL result cache (TTL/manual refresh, background execution, stale-serve on failure). Exposes `save-data-program`, `preview-data-program`, `run-data-program`, `list-data-programs`, `get-data-program`, and `delete-data-program` actions, a `data_program` sharing-registry entry (private by default, org sharing only — never public, since a shared program executes its author's code with the viewer's credentials), and is wired into every app automatically alongside `run-code`. No new sandboxing, credential, or SSRF code — all provider access flows through the existing sandbox bridge globals (`providerFetch`, `providerFetchAll`, `providerSearchAll`, `appAction`, `workspace*`), always executing with the calling viewer's own request context.
- e1ad535: Default agent SQL tools to read-only so app data writes go through typed actions unless raw write tools are explicitly enabled. Apps that intentionally rely on raw SQL writes must opt in with `databaseTools: "write"` (or `true`) to expose `db-exec` and `db-patch`.

### Patch Changes

- e1ad535: Add the generic `data-programs` skill to the workspace-core template, documenting the `emit(rows, schema)` contract, caching/refresh model, limits, and security invariants for the data-programs primitive so any workspace app can author and reuse stored, refreshable data sources.
- e1ad535: Fix email verification redirects so failed tokens do not show a verified state and resend actions keep a visible cooldown.
- e1ad535: Treat explicit empty local-file root lists as no roots instead of falling back to default roots.
- e1ad535: Clarify the legacy `.fig` compatibility helper so local file processing points to Builder design-system indexing.
- e1ad535: Fix hosted cross-app agent discovery so public runtimes do not advertise localhost A2A URLs, and use the Agent-Native Desktop webview clipboard bridge for shared chat copy actions.
- e1ad535: Add a Clips opt-in for Builder stable video asset URLs.
- e1ad535: Keep shared app shell headers, main content, mobile chrome, and extension iframes on the same semantic background surface instead of mixing a near-duplicate raised gray in dark mode.
- Updated dependencies [e1ad535]
  - @agent-native/toolkit@0.4.1

## 0.89.0

### Minor Changes

- 9d8c83c: Add durable background executions to the sandboxed `run-code` tool so long compute survives the hosted serverless run ceiling: pass `background: true` (or set `AGENT_NATIVE_SANDBOX=background`) and the code is enqueued to a new additive Postgres `sandbox_executions` table and executed out-of-band with a generous budget — self-dispatched to the new HMAC-verified `/_agent-native/sandbox/_process-execution` route on serverless, in-process on long-lived Node — with atomic single-claimer leasing, heartbeats, lease-expiry retries, owner-scoped status polling via `run-code {executionId}` (plus an exported `createGetCodeExecutionEntry` tool factory), opportunistic poll-time re-drives, and a warm-instance sweep so lost dispatches and dead executors are recovered instead of hanging; foreground `run-code` behavior is unchanged and the executor reuses the existing local sandbox adapter, bridge, and env-scrub machinery.
- 9d8c83c: Make long foreground agent-chat turns survivable without a durable-background deploy: add an opt-in, default-OFF `AGENT_CHAT_FOREGROUND_SELF_CHAIN` flag (same hosted + `A2A_SECRET` gating as durable background) that lets a foreground turn hitting its soft-timeout chunk boundary continue via a server-side self-dispatch to the `_process-run` route on the regular function — with the successor run row pre-inserted before the dispatch so `/runs/active` never shows an idle gap, the dispatch fully awaited with retry and the successor's atomic claim treated as acknowledgment, loud diag-stage + terminal-reason marking on failure that falls back to the existing client `auto_continue` path, ids-only dispatch payloads, and coverage by the existing unclaimed-background-run sweep; the thread-slot atomic claim makes a racing client continuation reconnect to the successor instead of double-running. Also show a subtle "Keep this tab open" notice (new `KeepTabOpenNotice` component mounted beside the run-stuck banner) while a long foreground turn is depending on the client for its next continuation chunk, and register the `get-code-execution` background-execution poll tool alongside `run-code` in every registry that gets it.
- 9d8c83c: Let the embedded agent see images in tool results. Actions can attach screenshots or previews by returning a well-known optional `_agentImages` field (`{ url | data, mediaType, label }[]`, stripped from the JSON the model reads), and images returned by external MCP tools are converted instead of being collapsed to `[image: <mime>]` placeholders. Attached images ride the tool result as real vision blocks on the native Anthropic API and vision-capable AI-SDK providers (anthropic, openai, google, openrouter), and degrade to compact text notes everywhere else (Builder gateway, non-vision providers). Caps apply per result (max 4 images, ~2MB base64 each; oversize entries become explanatory notes), and the run ledger only ever stores the string result plus `[image: …]` notes — never base64 payloads. Also thread the model id into the direct-Anthropic max-output-token ceiling so 128K-capable models are no longer clamped to 64K on BYO-key deployments.

### Patch Changes

- 9d8c83c: Stabilize the system-prompt prefix for Anthropic prompt caching: the runtime-context block now carries only day-granular date info (precise current time moved to a per-turn <current-time> block in the user message), system prompts assemble stable-first with runtime context appended last, and the direct Anthropic engine now sets a moving cache breakpoint on the last user message so growing conversation history is cached turn-over-turn.
- 9d8c83c: Seed the shared LEARNINGS.md prompt resource from the project-root learnings.md on first boot (and point migrate-learnings at the shared LEARNINGS.md path the prompt actually reads), make the max-output-token ceiling model-aware (128K for Claude flagship and GPT-5.x models, 64K otherwise), and make the default navigate action throw on missing arguments instead of returning an error string.
- 9d8c83c: Fix the agent sidebar's resize handle sometimes leaving the whole page unable
  to select or copy text.

  The resize handle set `document.body.style.userSelect = "none"` on mousedown
  (so a drag doesn't select page text) and only cleared it on `mouseup`. If the
  drag ended abnormally -- the mouse button released outside the browser
  window/iframe, or the effect unmounted/re-ran mid-drag (sidebar layout
  change, fullscreen toggle) -- `mouseup` never fired and `userSelect` stayed
  stuck at `"none"` for the rest of the session, silently breaking selection and
  copy everywhere in the app, including agent chat responses. Now a
  `window` `blur` listener and the effect cleanup both unconditionally restore
  `userSelect`, so a stuck state can no longer persist. The DB admin SQL
  editor's splitter drag had the same defect and gets the same fix.

- 9d8c83c: Allow app-provided LLM deploy environment keys to power signed-in hosted apps while keeping identity-bearing deploy credentials scoped.
- 9d8c83c: Fix agent chat starter suggestions so clicking them submits through the normal chat queue.
- 9d8c83c: Collaborative docs now share one connection per document per tab (ref-counted registry), eliminating duplicate poll/state/awareness traffic when multiple components mount the same doc.
- 9d8c83c: Reduce full-page reload churn while an agent (e.g. Builder Fusion) is editing app source in dev: coalesce the AGENTS.md / SKILL.md watcher's dev-server full-reload into a single reload per write burst (module invalidation still happens per event), and add a 2s cooldown to the host-bridge `hardReload` / `hard-reload` postMessage commands so an embedding host cannot keep the page permanently mid-reload.
- 9d8c83c: Keep the shared Extensions create popover above raised app surfaces and within the viewport.
- 9d8c83c: Prevent reconnect replay from showing duplicate agent tool-call rows while a run is still streaming.
- 9d8c83c: Fix Vite dev i18n context sharing, self-hosted native SSR externalization, and rich editor collab seeding after initial Yjs sync.
- 9d8c83c: Sync the headless scaffold's `agent-native-docs` skill with the canonical copy (restores the packaged source-corpus guidance and `source-search` usage it had missed), and extend the workspace-skills sync guard to cover `packages/core/src/templates/headless/.agents/skills` so it can no longer drift silently.
- 9d8c83c: Keep shared app-shell header normalization scoped to tablet and desktop, and use dynamic viewport height for mobile shells so mobile top bars and content areas stay compact and stable.
- 9d8c83c: `isOAuthConnected` no longer reports an account as connected when its stored token bundle parses to an empty object — the signature of an `oauth_tokens` row that failed to decrypt after a `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` / `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` rotation. Previously such rows kept the provider looking "connected" while every API call failed with an undefined bearer token, hiding the reconnect banner. Unusable rows are deliberately not deleted, since a decrypt failure can also mean the current process holds the wrong key (e.g. a dev server sharing a prod database) while the row is still decryptable by a correctly configured deployment.
- 9d8c83c: Keep the Plan mode pill attached to the composer instead of floating against the pane edge in wide centered chat layouts.
- 9d8c83c: Move the agent sidebar close button beside the header overflow menu and fade the whole sidebar chat header in only on hover or focus.
- 9d8c83c: Move reusable agent/workspace settings into full-page settings tabs and disable the right sidebar settings mode in the shared AgentSidebar.
- 9d8c83c: Reduce background polling: dynamic suggestions now event-driven with a slow safety net, run-stuck detection only polls the active chat tab, runs tray polls at 3s.
- 9d8c83c: Remove the redundant Back to app control from shared extension pages.
- 9d8c83c: Remove the global notification bell from template app chrome and move the Extensions hidden-items control into a three-dot menu.
- 9d8c83c: Add Toolkit provider overrides, collaboration UI, and sharing UI entrypoints while preserving core client compatibility re-exports. The core re-exports are temporary migration shims; the long-term dependency direction is Toolkit composing core runtime APIs, not core permanently owning reusable app-building UI. Future behaviorful kits should be extracted one at a time, with Sharing as the first candidate to validate access checks, action-backed data, and share-link UI together.
- 9d8c83c: transcribe-voice reliability: raise the dictation-cleanup text cap from 40k to 150k chars, truncate the middle (with a visible marker and a server-side warning) instead of silently dropping the tail when the cap is still exceeded, and abort in-flight provider fetches (Whisper-compatible, Gemini, Builder cleanup, chat-provider cleanup) when the client disconnects mid-request so abandoned dictation attempts stop burning provider time.

- Updated dependencies [b24446e]
  - @agent-native/toolkit@0.2.0

## 0.86.1

- 097d59b: Prevent reconnect replay text from temporarily duplicating assistant sidebar responses that are already visible.
- 097d59b: Add shared Builder DSI helpers for template design-system indexing.
- 097d59b: Expose target-aware database admin helpers and let the shared DB admin page use admin-gated custom API paths.

## 0.86.0

### Minor Changes

- 622d552: Collaborative editing kit: agent edits now behave like a visible collaborator
  and undo is per-user everywhere.
  - Agent presence lingers (~6s) after edits instead of vanishing instantly;
    any agent-sourced collab write (`applyText`, `searchAndReplace`, `applyJson`,
    `applyPatchOps`) automatically publishes presence plus lingering edit
    attribution — no per-action wiring required (`agentTouchDocument`).
  - New `recentEdits` awareness convention with `useRecentEdits`,
    `publishRecentEdit`, and the `RecentEditHighlights` overlay — fading,
    name/avatar-flagged highlights over regions a human or the AI just edited.
  - New shared per-user undo primitives: `useCollabUndo` (Y.UndoManager
    lifecycle with local-origin scoping) and `useLocalOpUndo` /
    `createLocalOpUndoController` (inverse-op undo for op-based apps that never
    reverts other participants' work).
  - `CollabUser.avatarUrl` renders profile images in `PresenceBar`,
    `LiveCursorOverlay`, and `RemoteSelectionRings`; selection descriptors may
    now carry labels (`{ selector, label }`), and agent selection tags no longer
    render as "AI — AI".
  - Presence now survives multi-instance/serverless deployments: awareness
    state is mirrored to a new additive Postgres `_collab_awareness` table, so cursors and the
    agent's presence written in one invocation are visible to clients polling
    any other instance.
  - Surgical reconcile: `useCollabReconcile` now applies authoritative external
    content by diffing top-level nodes and replacing only the changed run
    (new `parseValue` option, `applyDocSurgically`/`diffTopLevel` exports)
    instead of a whole-document `setContent` — unchanged block NodeViews are
    never torn down, remote carets stop jumping, and Collaboration sees minimal
    Yjs ops. Falls back to `setContent` when no parsed doc is available.

- 622d552: Add `ensureAdditiveColumns` (`@agent-native/core/db`), a boot-time helper that diffs each Drizzle table's declared columns against the live database and additively `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN`s any that are missing. This closes the gap where a column added to a Drizzle schema without a matching hand-written migration silently 500s every query on pre-existing production tables (fresh dev databases don't show the bug because `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` always includes new columns). It only ever adds missing columns — never drops, renames, or retypes existing ones — skips `NOT NULL` columns with no safe backfill default, and is wired into the analytics template's `server/plugins/db.ts` after its authoritative migrations run.
- 622d552: Add optional name-based tracking to `runMigrations` (`@agent-native/core/db`): a migration entry can now set a stable, unique `name` slug that is tracked independently of its `version` number in a companion `<table>_named` bookkeeping table. This fixes a collision class where two branches that each independently extend the same migration list under the same version numbers cause whichever deploys first to "claim" those version numbers, silently skipping the other branch's DDL forever — the exact failure that left the analytics template's `analytics_alert_rules`, `analytics_alert_incidents`, and `session_recordings.network_error_count` missing in production despite `analytics_migrations` reporting every version as applied. Unnamed migrations keep the exact legacy `version > MAX(version)` behavior; a duplicate `name` in a migration list throws at startup.
- 622d552: Session replay network capture now records a bounded, redacted response-body snippet for 5xx (server error) responses, so agents can see the actual server error message. Request bodies and headers are still never captured, and non-5xx or network-failure responses never carry a body. Configurable via `sessionReplay.network.captureErrorBodies` (default `true`) and `maxErrorBodyLength` (default 2048 chars).

### Patch Changes

- 622d552: Live collab updates now push over SSE to read-only viewer sharees, not just the
  resource owner and org members. Collab events are tagged with their
  resourceType/resourceId, and the per-user delivery filter runs an access-aware
  (cached, fail-closed) check against the same `resolveAccess` authority used by
  the collab routes — so a viewer with explicit access sees edits at push latency
  instead of falling back to the poll cycle, while unauthorized users are never
  delivered events.
- 622d552: Shared rich-markdown editors can now disable the default markdown surgical
  parser when they own a custom value format, preventing JSON-backed editor content
  from being interpreted as literal markdown.
- 622d552: Data-fetch hot-path hardening: faster loads, bounded hangs, fewer round trips.
  - `useActionQuery` now threads React Query's per-fetch `AbortSignal` into the
    network request, so superseded fetches (key change, unmount, rapid refetch)
    actually cancel instead of holding a per-origin connection slot.
  - Every action fetch is bounded by a 60s timeout (override via
    `callAction(..., { timeoutMs })`); a hung server surfaces a typed timeout
    error instead of an infinite spinner, and timeouts are not silently retried.
  - Action query retries back off in ~0.5–2s steps instead of React Query's
    1s/2s/4s, so real failures surface in about a quarter of the time.
  - Collaborative docs no longer open their own `EventSource` per doc (one for
    updates, one for awareness): they subscribe to the shared sync transport via
    the new `subscribeSyncEvents` API, so a tab holds exactly ONE SSE connection
    no matter how many docs are mounted — previously 3+ streams could starve the
    browser's per-origin connection budget and stall unrelated data fetches.
  - Awareness (cursor/presence) events no longer trigger the framework-level
    query-invalidation sweep on every peer keystroke.
  - The `/_agent-native/poll` fallback now backs off exponentially (cap 30s) on
    consecutive non-auth failures instead of hammering a down server at full
    cadence.
  - Session org backfill and `getOrgContext` now share one per-request
    `org_members` lookup, and `getSetting`/`getUserSetting` reads are memoized
    per request — several DB round trips removed from every authenticated
    action call.
  - Chat-thread share links resolve through a new indexed `share_token_hash`
    column (additive, with legacy-blob fallback + opportunistic backfill)
    instead of a `LIKE '%hash%'` scan over every thread's full message blob.
  - Queued-message saves no longer pre-read the full thread blob a second time
    on every debounced composer write.
  - The Drizzle Postgres path gets per-op timeout and connection-error retry
    protection.
  - `agent_checkpoints` gains indexes on `(thread_id, created_at)` and `run_id`.
  - Schema-prompt introspection coalesces concurrent cache-miss rebuilds;
    recurring-job runs no longer leak a live 5-minute backstop timer; a failed
    migration-connection open no longer poisons the shared exec singleton;
    `detachThread` no longer applies its optimistic update when the server
    rejects the change; `useAgentEngineConfigured` guards against out-of-order
    responses overwriting newer state.

- 622d552: Add a token-gated `POST /list-files` endpoint to the `design connect` localhost bridge (recursive walk honoring a simple `.gitignore` subset, always-ignored build/dependency directories, binary/size filtering, and a 20,000-entry cap), broaden the bridge's writable text-file extension allowlist beyond `.html`/`.htm`/`.css` to common web/code/text formats, and add a secret-path blocklist (`.env*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `id_rsa*`, anything under `.git/`) enforced across `/read-file`, `/write-file`, `/apply-edit`, and `/list-files`. The manifest now advertises additive `listFiles`/`readTextFiles`/`writeTextFiles` capabilities for the Design app's code workbench.

  Harden the bridge further: `assertPathInside` now also rejects a symlink at
  the target path itself (not just a symlink in an ancestor directory), closing
  a confinement bypass where a pre-existing symlink leaf inside the root could
  point outside it and be silently followed by `/read-file`, `/write-file`, or
  `/apply-edit`. The secret-path blocklist is now case-insensitive end to end
  (bridge and the Design app's `write-local-file` action), so uppercase or
  mixed-case variants like `.ENV`, `ID_RSA`, or `KEY.PEM` are blocked the same
  as their lowercase form — required on case-insensitive filesystems such as
  macOS's default APFS. `/read-file` now returns a `versionHash` derived from
  the file's mtime/size, and `/write-file` and `/apply-edit` accept an optional
  `expectedVersionHash`: when provided and the file's current hash does not
  match, the bridge responds `409` with `{ error: "version conflict",
currentVersionHash }` instead of overwriting concurrent changes, and
  successful writes echo back the new `versionHash`. The Design app's
  `write-local-file` and `read-local-file` actions and the code workbench's
  localhost workspace provider forward this version chain end to end, and the
  workbench now polls open localhost tabs every 5 seconds so external edits
  (made directly on disk or by the agent through the bridge) show up without a
  manual reload.

- 622d552: Keep Electron Google sign-in polling active after the desktop app regains focus.
- 622d552: Add server helpers for the Builder Fusion app-building backend: ensure branch
  containers and resolve preview URLs, send fire-and-forget prompts to the
  in-container coding agent, push branch code to git, reserve hosting slugs, and
  trigger/poll hosted deploys.
- 622d552: Make durable agent run recovery quieter by idempotently handling retried run rows and waiting longer for server-owned background continuations.
- 622d552: Emit PostHog-compatible `$ai_generation` tracking events from instrumented agent runs so LLM cost, latency, tokens, and errors can flow through configured tracking providers, and expose the shared database admin page through the client barrel for app-owned admin surfaces.
- 622d552: Persist local Plan bridge comments to comments.json so local visual plans and recaps can collect feedback without hosted database writes.
- 622d552: Upgrade React Router to 8.1.0 to silence Vite's deprecated `envFile` warning during dev startup.
- 622d552: Remove retired scaffold aliases from template catalogs and app pickers.
- 622d552: Fix duplicate tool-call cards and parallel duplicate text streaming in agent chat: the reconnect reader and the adapter's own stream can no longer attach to the same run concurrently (single-reader ownership — reconnect probes skip while the adapter runtime is live, and an adapter takeover aborts any active reconnect reader and discards its accumulator), journal/ledger-replayed tool results now merge into the original card instead of rendering a second stuck-spinner copy, and reconnect content drops pending tool cards whose call already completed in the rendered messages.
- 622d552: Add shared visual style controls for template editor inspector surfaces.
- 622d552: Add `/visualize-repo` and a local visual docs CLI for repo-backed Plan workspaces.

## 0.85.7

### Patch Changes

- b2e1b6c: Fix presence local-echo re-renders and coalesce pinch-zoom updates through requestAnimationFrame. `usePresence` no longer re-derives and re-renders subscribers when an awareness "change" event only reflects the local client's own state (e.g. cursor/selection echoes), and `usePinchZoom` now batches wheel and touch pinch zoom updates to at most one state update per animation frame instead of one per input event. When multiple wheel events land in the same animation frame, the cursor-anchored scroll compensation now accumulates across all of them (matching the pre-batching, one-event-at-a-time result) instead of anchoring later events in the burst against the stale pre-burst scroll position.

## 0.85.6

### Patch Changes

- be6d307: Make stalled chat auto-continues change strategy instead of repeating oversized action inputs.

## 0.85.5

### Patch Changes

- bd7c040: Auto-continue active chat reconnects when action preparation stalls, and count first action-prep events as durable progress.

## 0.85.4

### Patch Changes

- 00c6f16: Keep chat restore and active-run polling on the durable background timeout budget so healthy long-running background turns do not look stale to the browser.

## 0.85.3

### Patch Changes

- c213eb8: Allow durable background agent runs to wait longer between real progress events before checkpointing, so large hosted tool generations can use the background-function budget instead of retrying every few minutes.

## 0.85.2

### Patch Changes

- b4c0b9d: Keep chat retry clear events from extending durable no-progress windows.

## 0.85.1

### Patch Changes

- c67d671: Keep background chat continuation rows terminal and preserve Design edit recovery guidance across retries.

## 0.85.0

### Minor Changes

- b68e4f7: Session replay now captures browser console logs and network request metadata while recording, emitted as tagged rrweb custom events (`agent-native.console` / `agent-native.network`). Capture is on by default when session replay is enabled and configurable via new `console` / `network` options (boolean or object) on the session replay config. Request/response bodies and headers are never captured, URLs are scrubbed, messages are truncated, recorder self-traffic is excluded, and per-session budgets (1000 console / 2000 network events) add a truncation notice.

### Patch Changes

- b68e4f7: Show a clearer chat recovery message when a model provider returns a bare 401 response.
- b68e4f7: Retry internal chat continuations when the server briefly reports the same completed run as active.
- b68e4f7: Make durable background chat runs reliable end-to-end: continuation handoffs are now transactional (the successor run row is inserted before dispatch, the dispatch response is fully awaited with retries instead of racing a 250ms settle timer from a finishing Lambda, and a lost handoff is reaped into a loud error by a new unclaimed-run sweep instead of hanging silently); background dispatch bodies stay under Netlify's 256KB background-function cap by persisting the chat payload on the run row and rehydrating it in the worker; a run-manager-level no-progress backstop covers stall segments the in-loop watchdogs never see; and a durable SQL per-turn run budget bounds pathological continuation loops across every recovery path.
- b68e4f7: Keep the Extensions sidebar create button hidden until the section is hovered or focused.
- b68e4f7: Add hosted runtime diagnostics, schema health probes, and server response status telemetry.

## 0.84.67

### Patch Changes

- 171f6e6: Remove app document CSP headers so hosted Google Tag Manager and framework inline bootstrap scripts are not blocked or reported by a shared policy.

## 0.84.66

### Patch Changes

- 70a6085: Keep hosted chat runs inside the active worker when a progress-aware action-preparation checkpoint asks to continue, instead of depending on the browser to start the recovery turn.

## 0.84.65

### Patch Changes

- d569c7a: Retry internal chat continuations when the server briefly reports the same completed run as active.

## 0.84.64

### Patch Changes

- 70e18ac: Recover agent runs when a model stream stays open with keepalives but stops producing text, tool input, or tool calls.

## 0.84.63

### Patch Changes

- 231460f: Recover action preparation stalls even when the model stream goes silent before sending any tool input bytes.

## 0.84.62

### Patch Changes

- b9cac68: Mark interrupted activity-only tool cards as errors so stopped agent actions do not appear successful.

## 0.84.61

### Patch Changes

- 3a66817: Recover share access lookups when a hosted database is missing newer additive resource columns, and prefer Netlify unpooled database URLs for migrations.

## 0.84.60

### Patch Changes

- 4b6ca6c: Loosen the document script CSP allowances so hosted Google Tag Manager scripts and framework inline bootstrap scripts do not trigger CSP violations.

## 0.84.59

### Patch Changes

- 13379f1: Fix empty responses from non-Anthropic models (GPT-5.x, Gemini) on the Builder
  gateway. Action tool schemas generated from `z.record(...)` emitted a
  `propertyNames` JSON Schema keyword that OpenAI's function-calling validator
  rejects with `400 invalid_function_parameters`, producing an empty assistant
  turn. Tool schemas now strip `propertyNames` so they stay portable across
  providers (Anthropic already ignored it).

## 0.84.58

### Patch Changes

- cdc9033: Recover durable background chat runs when action input preparation stops making byte progress, and avoid duplicate tool cards when reconnects replay completed tool events.
- cdc9033: Remove the shadow from agent chat context scope pills.
- cdc9033: Prevent agent chat sidebars from jittering around nested scroll areas and suppress replayed reconnect tool cards that are already rendered in the saved thread.

## 0.84.57

### Patch Changes

- 5250e7f: Document temporary agent links for session replays and private clips.

## 0.84.56

### Patch Changes

- a0615f8: Make PR visual recap screenshots link directly to the interactive recap and publish source-author metadata for recap comments.

## 0.84.55

### Patch Changes

- ea97dc1: Make agent chat setup, auth, and title state resilient to transient status checks and hidden context payloads.

## 0.84.54

### Patch Changes

- a259f96: Keep centered chat composers stable when the Connect AI setup card appears.
- df3fcfd: Allow wireframe and diagram blocks to opt in or out of their outer visual frame.

## 0.84.53

### Patch Changes

- 899ebf1: Hide the diff "Show all lines" footer when annotation anchoring already renders every line.
- c1e18fb: Make session replay uploads retry failed batches without advancing sequence ids.

## 0.84.52

### Patch Changes

- ca38cc7: Carry action-preparation stall detection across reconnect reads for the same run so zero-byte tool input retries cannot keep background chats alive indefinitely.
- 899ebf1: Hide the diff "Show all lines" footer when annotation anchoring already renders every line.
- c1e18fb: Make session replay uploads retry failed batches without advancing sequence ids.

## 0.84.51

### Patch Changes

- 55e4678: Recover durable background chat runs when action input preparation stops making byte progress, and avoid duplicate tool cards when reconnects replay completed tool events.

## 0.84.50

### Patch Changes

- 24a6bd2: Retry agent chat startup timeouts before showing an error when no run stream starts.

## 0.84.49

### Patch Changes

- 5b96985: Recover agent runs that keep restarting empty tool input preparation without streaming action arguments.

## 0.84.48

### Patch Changes

- f99bea8: Recover long-running agent turns that repeatedly prepare zero-byte tool inputs.

## 0.84.47

### Patch Changes

- a234670: Keep explicit `nextRequiredAction` tool-result guidance visible in automatic continuation prompts even when the full tool result is too large to include.

## 0.84.46

### Patch Changes

- e7eacaa: Recover stalled action preparation when a provider emits a zero-byte tool input delta without a start event.

## 0.84.45

### Patch Changes

- a4f9e3e: Keep action preparation stall detection active after prepared tool-call snapshots until the tool actually starts.

## 0.84.44

### Patch Changes

- 79726e5: Keep action preparation stall detection active across assistant text snapshots so hosted runs recover from zero-byte tool prep.

## 0.84.43

### Patch Changes

- 7fe87d0: Keep tracking action-input preparation stalls across empty assistant snapshots so hosted runs recover from silent zero-byte tool prep.

## 0.84.42

### Patch Changes

- f24d6d4: Recover durable background agent runs that repeatedly restart the same action input without streaming any bytes.

## 0.84.41

### Patch Changes

- a8548bc: Continue durable background runs when a chunk completes tool calls without final assistant text.

## 0.84.40

### Patch Changes

- 96feefd: Checkpoint agent runs that stall while preparing an action input without streaming bytes.

## 0.84.39

### Patch Changes

- ca6912b: Fix hosted Google Analytics / Tag Manager injection by baking the measurement id into Nitro server bundles and merging the required GA/GTM script, connect, and image hosts into existing stricter document CSPs.

## 0.84.38

### Patch Changes

- 203c1c3: Keep durable background chat runs attached during long action preparation instead of aborting on keepalive-only or zero-byte preparation activity.

## 0.84.37

### Patch Changes

- 885a0bd: Hide docs formatter guards from rendered content, refine assistant recovery status labels, and keep live background workers from being auto-retried as stuck.

## 0.84.36

### Patch Changes

- 1cf5c2b: Remove the outer artboard outline and default backdrop fill from docs wireframe blocks while preserving rough outlines and fills for wireframe UI elements.
- 11b8b66: Reframe getting-started and related docs around chat-first agentic applications, with no-browser apps repositioned as automation-first workflows.
- 2d984a0: Add a portable Drizzle alias helper for backend-agnostic template queries.
- 72a92af: Align docs wireframe status rows with labels on the left and values on the right.
- 11b8b66: Automatically recover active chat runs that stop making real progress while the worker is still alive.
- d04226c: Clarify the Getting Started inline result example with a shorter widget snippet and wireframe.
- 51425d9: Render standard docs wireframe primitives and inline border dividers with sketchy rough outlines by default.

## 0.84.35

### Patch Changes

- 3dea26c: Fix hosted Google Analytics / Tag Manager injection by baking the measurement id into Nitro server bundles and merging the required GA/GTM script, connect, and image hosts into existing stricter document CSPs.
- 3dea26c: Improve chat tool-preparation UX by hiding zero-byte progress, using clearer preparation/writing copy, and showing a delayed long-running update hint.
- 3dea26c: Improve background chat streaming smoothness by streaming guarded final text live and using adaptive SQL polling while run events are actively arriving.

## 0.84.34

### Patch Changes

- 56f3d91: Fix hosted Google Analytics / Tag Manager injection by baking the measurement id into Nitro server bundles and merging the required GA/GTM script, connect, and image hosts into existing stricter document CSPs.

## 0.84.33

### Patch Changes

- 8cc9620: Keep Nitro/Vite dev servers responsive when native file watchers hit EMFILE or ENOSPC by falling back to polling instead of replacing failed watches with no-ops.

## 0.84.32

### Patch Changes

- da8ac0a: Keep tail-resume reconnect content display-only, recover zero-byte action-prep stalls, and polish Design screen tool labels.

## 0.84.31

## 0.84.28

### Patch Changes

- ffd5b99: Make agent chat thread handoffs robust when opening the panel from external UI controls.

## 0.84.27

### Patch Changes

- 6fb954b: Require admin access for shareable resource visibility changes.

## 0.84.26

### Patch Changes

- f041345: Track action-preparation progress by streamed tool-input id so parallel same-name tool calls do not hide real progress.

## 0.84.25

### Patch Changes

- a11293f: Keep tail-resume reconnect content display-only, recover zero-byte action-prep stalls, and polish Design screen tool labels.

## 0.84.24

### Patch Changes

- d88a57f: Fix chat tool-call rows shrinking, keep running chats visibly thinking, stream reconnect content incrementally, and collapse exact repeated tool rows.

## 0.84.23

### Patch Changes

- fde28eb: Expose notification delivery channel results so callers can distinguish custom-channel delivery from inbox persistence.
- fde28eb: Re-enable Claude Sonnet 5 as the visible and default Sonnet model now that the Builder gateway supports it.
- fde28eb: Sharpen the exported Design skill's quality bar to defeat "AI slop": frame the variant flow as separating taste/exploration/spec/code, pair every banned default with a concrete alternative, warn about second-order convergence, and add explicit guidance for building on an existing design system or codebase.

## 0.84.22

### Patch Changes

- 72d6a3e: Add built-in Slack webhook and email notification channels, keep chat status visible through auto-continuation handoffs, and make guided-question option values authoritative in follow-up context.
- 72d6a3e: Send both Builder upload compression-skip query params for compatibility with the production upload API rollout.
- 72d6a3e: Make the document Report-Only script-src CSP account for the framework-injected Google Analytics / Tag Manager loader and inline gtag config script, so GA no longer triggers a CSP violation on every page load (it was Report-Only, so GA was never actually blocked) and the policy stays safe to graduate to enforcement.

## 0.84.21

### Patch Changes

- f883173: Refresh public booking branding with a plain Agent-Native logo, updated open-source copy, and a ghost icon language picker for public pages.
- f883173: Fix PR visual recap gating and comments so nested AGENTS.md files no longer count as recap-control files, trusted write actors can recap control-file edits, stale success bodies are replaced by skipped comments, and screenshot capture no longer waits for network-idle.
- f883173: Offer Claude Opus 4.8 in the managed Builder gateway model picker, keep action-preparation recovery progress-aware for large streamed tool inputs, retry A2A auth with org-scoped bearer fallbacks in mixed deployments, and allow Builder uploads to skip waiting on server-side compression when callers can process asynchronously.

## 0.84.20

### Patch Changes

- 93ed23b: Use a filter icon instead of a gear icon for the Extensions sidebar section sort/filter options trigger.
- ce62d53: Fix extension iframe theme inheritance and add source-code editor. Extensions now correctly inherit the host app's dark/light theme and CSS custom properties instead of rendering with a white background. Adds a raw HTML/Alpine.js source editor dialog to ExtensionViewer so extensions can be edited directly without going through the AI chat.

## 0.84.19

### Patch Changes

- 92b576f: Keep durable background agent runs from being reported as stale after a terminal event was already persisted, and show tool activity during tail reconnects.

## 0.84.18

### Patch Changes

- fb0021b: Send compressed session replay uploads as binary payloads so Netlify preserves gzip bytes.

## 0.84.17

### Patch Changes

- a4f5303: Keep background chat continuation markers and database pool detection aligned with the actual background function dispatch path.

## 0.84.16

### Patch Changes

- 564460a: Add an optional `focus` flag to `setAgentChatContextItem` (and thread it through to the composer). Callers that mirror ambient UI state into chat context — such as a design canvas element selection — can now pass `focus: false` to stage the context chip without moving keyboard focus into the composer. This stops passive context staging from blurring and tearing down an in-progress inline text editor in the Design canvas (which re-fires on every selection and on each get-design poll during an agent run). Focus stays enabled by default, so existing callers are unchanged.
- 2b27c0f: Avoid unsupported array helpers in Builder engine message caching and stabilize prep-load tests.
- a4f5303: Keep background chat continuation markers and database pool detection aligned with the actual background function dispatch path.

## 0.84.15

### Patch Changes

- 946ff86: Fix the "No LLM provider is connected" chat banner staying visible after a
  provider is connected. The composer now clears that error once the engine
  status flips to configured, and the status check no longer reads a stale
  cached "missing" response after connecting.

## 0.84.14

### Patch Changes

- bbc0a56: Persist terminal reasons for agent runs and classify recoverable run-timeout continuations separately in traces.
- bbc0a56: Improve agent run diagnostics by recording terminal continuation reasons and adding safe run context to copied recovery debug details.
- bbc0a56: Keep visual plan and recap diagram labels wrapped inside their boxes instead of overflowing authored diagram shapes.

## 0.84.13

### Patch Changes

- dd5b0a4: Honor the long Netlify background-function timeout for durable agent-chat workers and record runtime diagnostics when a background run starts.
- dd5b0a4: Make agent chat recovery surface completed-tool timeouts more reliably and keep Design variant follow-ups bounded to the selected screen.
- dd5b0a4: Double the agent chat smooth-streaming reveal speed.
- dd5b0a4: Avoid noisy Sentry reports from expected chat auth states and best-effort client thread-save conflicts.
- dd5b0a4: Keep activity-only tool cards and the latest assistant message visibly running during agent chat continuations, steer interrupted Design generation retries toward smaller existing-file edits, and capture run persistence failures with run IDs so missing request IDs are diagnosable.
- dd5b0a4: Compress the Plan mode composer callout into a quieter inline status pill.

## 0.84.12

### Patch Changes

- 9032acb: Don't reap a run that is actively making progress. The stale reapers
  (`reapIfStale`, `reapAllStaleRuns`, and the heartbeat-stale path of
  `cleanupOldRuns`) keyed liveness solely on `heartbeat_at` (the 1.5s
  process-liveness timer) and ignored `last_progress_at` (bumped whenever the
  agent emits an event, including a long-running tool's periodic activity
  heartbeats — e.g. image generation streaming activity every 8s). When the
  heartbeat write lagged while a multi-minute tool was in flight, the run was
  flipped to `errored`, and the producing isolate's SQL-abort check then
  self-aborted the in-flight tool with "Run aborted" — looping on the
  durable-background self-chaining path and interrupting once inline. The reapers
  now use the most recent of `heartbeat_at` and `last_progress_at` (falling back to
  `started_at`) as their liveness basis, so a demonstrably-progressing run is never
  reaped mid-tool. Postgres-only; can only make reaping more
  conservative (a dead producer emits neither signal).
- 9032acb: Add a `trigger="label-icon"` option to `ShareButton` that renders a leading
  share glyph alongside the "Share" label, so the trigger matches adjacent
  icon+label buttons (e.g. an Upload button). The default `"label"` trigger stays
  text-only and `"icon"` stays icon-only.
- 351ee93: Fix an infinite sign-in redirect loop under base-path deploys. When the
  authenticated app shell (wrapped in `RequireSession`) was served at the sign-in
  path — e.g. `/<app>/_agent-native/sign-in` on a path-prefixed deploy — the gate
  redirected to the sign-in page from the sign-in page, nesting and re-encoding the
  current URL as a fresh `?return=` on every hop (`…sign-in?return=%252F…sign-in%253Freturn…`).
  `RequireSession` now refuses to redirect when already on the sign-in entry point
  (new exported `isOnSignInPage` helper), and `safeReturnPath` collapses any
  `return` that resolves back to `…/_agent-native/sign-in` to `/`.

## 0.84.11

### Patch Changes

- a2ce30e: Improve local Postgres collab write robustness for Design editor workflows.

## 0.84.10

### Patch Changes

- 720b8b0: Make agent chat recovery surface completed-tool timeouts more reliably and keep Design variant follow-ups bounded to the selected screen.

## 0.84.9

### Patch Changes

- 8cfc0ee: Show a visible warning when an agent stops after its final completed tool action, even if it sent text before that tool finished.

## 0.84.8

### Patch Changes

- b5cc580: Show a visible warning when an agent run completes tools but stops before sending any final assistant text.

## 0.84.7

### Patch Changes

- ab1e410: Stop repeated agent-chat action-preparation loops with a clear terminal warning, and let Design agents present compact variant directions without streaming large HTML payloads.

## 0.84.6

### Patch Changes

- 126ccac: Claim durable background agent-chat runs before expensive worker setup so hosted apps stay on the 15-minute background-function path instead of falling back to 40-second inline chunks.

## 0.84.5

### Patch Changes

- 1a8400a: Surface an explicit chat error when an agent stops before a displayed tool action starts or returns a result, and keep Design variant generation prompts compact enough to finish.

## 0.84.4

### Patch Changes

- 61715b4: Pin Nitro's `nf3` tracer dependency to a Node 22-compatible release so downstream package updates continue to build hosted apps.

## 0.84.3

### Patch Changes

- af049a8: Improve agent-chat timeout recovery so completed tool actions end with a clear saved-result note instead of a generic connection failure, and bound repeated no-progress tool stalls.
- af049a8: Allow share panels to hide copyable link fields, omit the bottom Done action, and render compact host-provided footer actions.
- af049a8: Stack nested share popover menus above their parent panel so users can change visibility.

## 0.84.2

### Patch Changes

- 3ff4f55: Extend Builder gateway timeouts for local and background agent-chat runs, and surface recoverable gateway timeout failures instead of silently retrying activity-only tool preparation loops.
- 3ff4f55: Allow scoped chat surfaces to hide the composer scope badge while keeping thread context attached.

## 0.84.1

### Patch Changes

- 87806ef: Report intentionally gated eval cases as skipped, keep skipped suites from setting up agent runners, and avoid action/engine setup for eval cases that fully short-circuit with custom run handlers.

## 0.84.0

### Minor Changes

- 31983c1: Add Claude Sonnet 5 to the managed Builder gateway and Anthropic model catalogs.

### Patch Changes

- 31983c1: Keep Builder.io Connect polling after the auth window closes so slow status confirmation does not show a false warning.
- 31983c1: Keep OAuth state and environment status checks aligned with scoped workspace credentials.
- 31983c1: Use Claude Opus 4.8 instead of 4.7 in the managed Builder gateway model catalog.
- 31983c1: Keep the Connect AI setup card aligned with the composer and stop stretching the Builder.io button in compact rows.
- 31983c1: Simplify guided question layout and keep chat-sidebar choices readable with container queries.
- 31983c1: Fix spacing in the Extensions sidebar sort menu.
- 31983c1: Allow generated deploy workers to accept browser action-client headers during CORS preflight.
- 31983c1: Keep lazy workspace gateway socket resets from crashing local dev servers.
- 31983c1: Add GLM 5.2 to the curated OpenRouter model catalog and setup copy.
- 31983c1: Disable recurring job and automation trigger background loading during local development.
- 31983c1: Expose a guarded localhost Design bridge snapshot endpoint so URL-backed visual-edit screens can become editable in Design without replacing their saved URL source.
- 31983c1: Use neutral button colors on the missing design screen.
- 31983c1: Render PR visual recap screenshots without wrapping the thumbnail image in a link.
- 31983c1: Prevent failed or blocked tool calls from being replayed as completed durable side effects.
- 31983c1: Allow apps to opt specific deep-link open targets into anonymous redirects.
- 31983c1: Temporarily hide Claude Sonnet 5 behind a code flag so Claude Sonnet 4.6 remains the visible Sonnet option and default until the Builder gateway deploy supports Sonnet 5.
- 31983c1: Use theme tokens for shared setup, onboarding, editor, and integration chrome.
- 31983c1: Tighten the sidebar Connect AI setup card so secondary API-key setup stays compact.
- 31983c1: Fix the exported visual-edit skill instructions so editable localhost sessions keep the Design bridge running.

## 0.83.0

### Minor Changes

- 1a8d939: Add dynamic command menu results and an opt-in contenteditable Cmd+K shortcut path for editor-backed apps.

## 0.82.0

### Minor Changes

- fe9fd99: Add optional `resumable` capability to `FileUploadProvider` for streaming uploads. Providers that implement `startSession`, `relayChunk`, and `completeSession` can receive video chunks during recording instead of waiting for a fully assembled file after stop. The Builder.io provider implements this via the GCS resumable upload protocol. Also exports `ResumableUploadSession` and `ResumableChunkResult` types.

## 0.81.3

### Patch Changes

- 3807702: Fix MCP App embed rendering in ChatGPT/Codex hosts:
  - Stop the `openai:set_globals` storm that left embeds stuck blanking by
    guarding the bridge sync on a signature that ignores host `maxHeight`, and
    by not re-blanking once the app frame has launched.
  - Size embeds to their content: the embedded app reports its real
    `scrollHeight` via `agentNative.contentHeight` and the shell sizes the iframe
    to that (plus chrome) instead of the host max, so plans no longer render far
    too tall or too short.
  - Suppress empty embeds: when a tool whose descriptor declares an embed widget
    produces no embeddable content, the result is marked `isError` so the host
    shows the text result without an empty widget box. This also keeps read-only
    and comment-mutation tools from rendering an embed for results that produce
    no plan surface.
  - Bump the embed shell resource version so hosts refetch the updated shell.

## 0.81.2

### Patch Changes

- ea1cc47: Keep OAuth state and environment status checks aligned with scoped workspace credentials.

## 0.81.1

### Patch Changes

- ec433c3: Add a close (X) button to the left of the Chat tab in the agent pane header that closes the agent chat, and hide the open-agent button while the agent pane is open.

## 0.81.0

### Minor Changes

- 3164729: Add secure localhost bridge write endpoints to the design connect bridge.

  `startDesignConnectBridge` now mints a cryptographically random per-session
  `bridgeToken` (exposed on the returned `DesignConnectBridge` object) and
  serves three new token-gated POST endpoints on the same localhost-only server:
  - `POST /read-file` — reads any file within the root (no extension restriction)
  - `POST /write-file` — writes `.html`, `.htm`, or `.css` files within the root
  - `POST /apply-edit` — patches an existing file via `{search, replace}` or
    replaces it entirely via `{content}`

  All three endpoints require the `X-Bridge-Token` header to match the minted
  token (constant-time comparison). Path confinement is enforced via
  `fs.realpath` on both the root and the target parent directory, blocking
  directory traversal and symlink escape attacks. The token is never serialised
  into the public `/manifest.json` response.

  The `DesignConnectManifest` capabilities array now marks `readFile`,
  `applyEdit`, and `writeFile` as `"available"` (previously `"planned"`).

### Patch Changes

- 3164729: Builder waitlist submissions now include a use-case field so Forms and Slack routing can distinguish background coding requests from Design publish requests.
- 3164729: Fix bridge token registration so design localhost write-back works end-to-end.

  `registerConnectionWithServer` is a new exported function that POSTs the
  bridge's real `bridgeToken` (minted by `startDesignConnectBridge`) to the
  design app's `connect-localhost` action endpoint on startup. This stores the
  token on the `designLocalhostConnections` row so `grant-localhost-write-consent`
  can read it instead of minting an unrelated token, which previously caused every
  bridge write to return 401.

  `DesignConnectArgs` gains an optional `appUrl` field (populated by the new
  `--app-url <url>` CLI flag or the `AGENT_NATIVE_URL` / `DESIGN_APP_URL` env
  vars) that controls where self-registration is sent. Registration is
  best-effort: if no app URL is configured or the request fails, the bridge
  continues running normally.

- 3164729: Register Figma as a Design provider API so Design actions can browse and render Figma library components through scoped `FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN` credentials.
- 3164729: Make the Connect AI setup card adapt to narrow chat sidebars with container queries.
- 3164729: Keep reserved organization switcher slots stable with a disabled loading placeholder.
- 3164729: Redirect relative PGlite data directories to writable `/tmp` paths on serverless runtimes.
- 3164729: Make the default shared share button outline trigger transparent at rest.

## 0.80.11

### Patch Changes

- abf0681: Stop chat reconnect from falsely reporting "stopped before finishing" on long but healthy runs. The active-run reconnect now treats the stuck threshold as an idle deadline that resets on every streamed event, instead of a one-shot cap on total reconnect duration — so a long-running tool (e.g. image generation) that keeps emitting activity heartbeats is never aborted with a no-progress error just for running longer than the threshold. Also surfaces active tool progress while reconnecting, and waits for interrupted write-tool results before re-running them so long-running tools do not appear stopped or duplicate work.

## 0.80.10

### Patch Changes

- d26a679: Design connect: document the per-element provenance contract (`data-source-file` / `data-source-line` / `data-source-column` / `data-component-name`, plus `data-loc` shorthand) used to map a selected element back to its source location, and surface it in `design connect --help`. The `resolveNodeToFile` bridge capability now carries a reason string describing this contract.
- d26a679: Harden the app-backed skill installer for visual-plan feedback: built-in skill folders now stage writes before replacing existing installs, include first-time install command metadata, and make `skills update` point first-time users to `skills add` for setup and MCP registration.

## 0.80.9

### Patch Changes

- 82c138c: Expose app main surfaces as named CSS query containers so templates can reflow against the available app pane instead of the viewport.
- 82c138c: ShareButton can render optional custom tabs beside the default share-link panel.
- 82c138c: Improve the exported Design skills with a clearer generation quality bar, updated variant-screen flow guidance, and more grounded visual-edit review instructions.
- 82c138c: Remove the extension viewer notification bell and place the vertical more menu before Share.
- 82c138c: Allow guided question options to submit immediately when selected, with optional per-question submit and skip message copy.
- 82c138c: Add a local Clips Screen Memory MCP stdio server for querying recent on-device screen context.
- 82c138c: Avoid CORS preflights for cross-origin session replay uploads so hosted apps can send recordings to the first-party analytics collector.

## 0.80.8

### Patch Changes

- 24deb20: Reduce noisy browser Sentry captures by filtering public-site source-less errors that only report their page URL as a Sentry tag, delaying reconnect aborts until active runs are truly stuck on the server clock, and recovering assistant-ui duplicate message-id append races before they escape.

## 0.80.7

### Patch Changes

- 72ef787: Add `onReady` and `onUnavailable` callbacks to `EmbeddedExtension`. `onReady` fires once when the embedded iframe first signals content readiness (its first height report, or iframe load as a fallback) — hosts that gate on content paint, such as dashboard report screenshots, can use it to avoid capturing a blank extension. `onUnavailable` fires when the extension can't be loaded for the current viewer (e.g. 403/404 because it isn't shared with them or no longer exists), so hosts can render an explanatory fallback instead of a silently blank panel.

## 0.80.6

### Patch Changes

- f52eeb1: Pin the scaffolded workspace Nitro tracer dependency so fresh installs keep building reliably.
- f52eeb1: Ignore shareable resource registrations that originate from test modules during app runtime.

## 0.80.5

### Patch Changes

- 8a43376: Allow app-level opt-in to durable background agent chat runs, let direct loop callers use that timeout regime, and expose per-action tool timeouts from `defineAction`.
- 8a43376: Route Figma/code design-system indexing through Builder and keep the legacy fig subpath as a compatibility shim.
- 8a43376: Expose the Design visual-edit skill in repo-local skill sync and generated app plugin bundles.
- 8a43376: Defer agent chat context subscriber updates so embedded chat rendering does not trigger render-phase updates in host apps.
- 8a43376: Make MCP install/connect idempotent for Codex `config.toml`. The writer now
  recognizes a server's sub-tables (`[mcp_servers.<name>.http_headers]`,
  `[mcp_servers.<name>.env]`, …) as part of its footprint, so re-installing or
  reconnecting a server clears stale sub-tables instead of leaving one behind as a
  duplicate TOML key. Same-URL alias cleanup removes the whole footprint too, and
  the AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md managed-instruction writers collapse any pre-existing
  duplicate blocks into a single block.
- 8a43376: Show a clear loading state while authorizing MCP device codes.
- 8a43376: Render label share buttons without a leading visibility icon.
- 8a43376: Show the Connect AI setup card and block submits from standalone prompt composers when no LLM is connected.

## 0.80.4

### Patch Changes

- fa56720: Fix video playback failing in workspace dev mode. When a browser requested video bytes (range/streaming requests), the dev server was stripping the app base path prefix before Nitro's media handler could run, causing Vite to return an error page instead of the video.

## 0.80.3

### Patch Changes

- 995dd3b: Add an opt-in `maxBodyBytes` option to `defineAction`. When set, the action
  HTTP route rejects oversize requests with 413 based on the declared
  `Content-Length` BEFORE buffering or parsing the body.

  This closes a gap for public, no-auth POST actions: previously the router parsed
  the full JSON body before any in-`run()` size check, so a large anonymous
  request could force parse work on an unauthenticated route. The check is
  runtime-agnostic (header only), so it works on both the web-`Request.json()` and
  Node `readBody` paths, and is unset by default so existing actions are
  unaffected. The Plan template's public `validate-local-plan-source` action opts
  in.

- 995dd3b: Make `plan local verify` validate plan content against the real renderer
  schema, and stop `plan local check` from reporting false greens.

  Previously both headless commands could pass a plan the renderer later rejects:
  `check` ran a hand-rolled regex lint (a subset of the schema that never
  inspected blocks authored as JSON inside a container's `tabs={[…]}` /
  `columns={[…]}` array), and `verify` only checked bridge/CORS transport, never
  the content. The plan then got stuck on "Loading plan" when rendered.

  Now:
  - `verify` POSTs the MDX folder to the Plan app's new, public, no-DB
    `validate-local-plan-source` action, which runs the renderer's own
    `parsePlanMdxFolder` + `planContentSchema`. Its verdict gates `verify`'s
    `ok`, and rejected plans surface the renderer's exact schema-path issue
    (e.g. `blocks[1].data.tabs[0].blocks[0].data.items[0].id`). When the endpoint
    is unavailable (older/unreachable Plan app), `verify` degrades to the
    transport checks and warns that content was not validated, rather than
    hard-failing.
  - `check` now recurses into nested `tabs` block arrays so the common
    nested-checklist / question-form / missing-`id` case is caught offline, and
    it no longer reports `validation: "passed"`. It reports a clearly-scoped
    `lint-passed` with a note pointing to `verify` for authoritative validation.

## 0.80.2

### Patch Changes

- 7b44f20: Fix MCP App embeds never becoming visible in ChatGPT/Codex (stuck on "Loading
  app", then the fallback panel). Two shell bugs in the inline-embed render path:
  1. `launchEmbed` called `setMessage("Loading app")` before the dedupe check, so
     the constant `openai:set_globals`-driven relaunches wiped the just-mounted
     iframe out of the stage on every cycle — the app rendered and was instantly
     blanked, never reaching its ready handshake. The loading message now only
     shows when no frame is mounted.
  2. The `openai:set_globals` handler re-synced unconditionally, and the sync
     itself called `notifyHostHeight()`/`sendHostContext()`, which the host
     reflected back as another `set_globals` — an infinite feedback storm that
     starved the host into its sad-face placeholder. `syncOpenAiBridge` now
     short-circuits when the relevant globals (tool input, open URLs, display
     mode, theme, locale) are unchanged.

  Bumps the embed shell version so hosts refetch the fixed shell.

## 0.80.1

### Patch Changes

- 1d77419: Route design-system indexing through Builder-managed design-system APIs while preserving the legacy compatibility export.
- 1d77419: Fix avatar lookup routes so profile photos load for users signed in through legacy Google OAuth sessions.
- 1d77419: Keep shared app shell outlines visible around the top corners when app content fills the main surface.

## 0.80.0

### Minor Changes

- aa345cc: Add `agent-native design connect` foundations for localhost Design bridge manifests.

### Patch Changes

- aa345cc: App shells use an outline-style raised surface ring and Dispatch left navigation can collapse to an animated icon rail.
- aa345cc: Live cursors now use compact pointer markers with adjacent participant labels.
- aa345cc: Surface missing LLM provider connections before agent chat starts a run, including Builder and AI SDK engines.
- aa345cc: Fix Chrome visual glitchiness (blank/stale regions on scroll, pan, and zoom) in
  plan documents and canvases by removing `backdrop-filter` (`backdrop-blur`) from
  always-rendered per-block controls. A long plan rendered 40+ per-block edit
  triggers, each forcing its own composited backdrop layer; Chrome re-samples every
  backdrop snapshot on each scroll frame and its backdrop-filter invalidation drops
  tiles, leaving regions blank until the next repaint. The tiny hover-trigger chips
  now use an opaque background, which is visually identical but eliminates the
  composited backdrop layers. Affects the block edit trigger, diagram/mermaid
  expand/style triggers, and wireframe style trigger.
- aa345cc: Allow embedded MCP App controls to target their own local agent sidebar instead of relaying every submitted prompt to the host chat.
- aa345cc: Respect silent chat context staging across app/frame boundaries so selection context can update without opening the agent sidebar.
- aa345cc: Polish the shared chat thinking status with capitalized text and a subtle shine animation.
- aa345cc: Add the Design `/visual-edit` skill and route it through the built-in skill installers so agents can open localhost routes as URL-backed Design screens.
- aa345cc: Improve voice transcription and cleanup with bounded voice context packs for active composer context, learned vocabulary, and transcript cleanup prompts.

## 0.79.27

### Patch Changes

- 087be08: Show Gemini and other installed API-key-backed providers in the chat model picker.
- 087be08: Add a `agent-native content local-files` launcher for local Content editing, propagate local file profiles through manifests, and support standard MDX child code fences for Diagram block authoring.
- 087be08: Allow the framework Settings email panel to save Resend and SendGrid provider keys for transactional email and dashboard reports.
- 087be08: Move Portuguese and Chinese locale options directly under German in locale pickers.
- 087be08: Add a shared MCP integrations catalog dialog to the composer and Workspace create menus, with configurable default remote server presets plus custom server setup.
- 087be08: Simplify the chat thinking indicator to plain text without the logo or animated dots.
- 087be08: Reduce noisy browser Sentry reports from public docs visitors and harden organization member search SQL.
- 087be08: Keep shared wireframe blocks readable in dark mode by stripping host theme utility classes and avoiding overlapping rough outlines around broad helper containers.

## 0.79.26

### Patch Changes

- 27f630c: Fix Windows desktop (Tauri) email/password sign-in. The login endpoint now
  returns the session token to the Windows WebView2 origin
  (`http://tauri.localhost` / `https://tauri.localhost`), which was missing from
  the desktop token allowlist, so sign-in no longer silently bounces back to the
  form. Also stop reporting wrong-password failures as "Enter a valid email
  address" — credential errors now surface as "Invalid email or password" while
  genuine malformed-email input still gets the friendly format message.

## 0.79.25

### Patch Changes

- 8bac54f: Expose the optional image model menu through AgentSidebar so app sidebars can show secondary generation model controls.

## 0.79.24

### Patch Changes

- 2c214f1: Fix French docs MDX block serialization so markdown mirrors do not expose raw component tags.

## 0.79.23

### Patch Changes

- 7bde747: Ship framework docs source as MDX and generate clean Markdown mirrors for docs pages.

## 0.79.22

### Patch Changes

- cdf41db: Require signed-in email identity for browser session replay by default across templates and send replay timing/event-count metadata with each upload. Apps that intentionally record anonymous replay sessions can opt out with `sessionReplay.requireSignedInUser: false` or `VITE_AGENT_NATIVE_SESSION_REPLAY_REQUIRE_AUTH=false`.
- cdf41db: Keep diagram primitive borders visible in sketchy Plan diagrams and stop the shared feedback button from sending synthetic anonymous Agent-Native emails.
- cdf41db: Add an advanced OpenAI-compatible endpoint URL setting for custom gateways like LiteLLM.
- cdf41db: Default shared expandable code surfaces to 30 visible lines before the reader
  expands them.

## 0.79.21

### Patch Changes

- 3acd677: Clarify workspace Docker Compose deployment for self-hosted VPS installs.

## 0.79.20

### Patch Changes

- 8bcc21d: Declare the Sentry OpenTelemetry trace dependency directly so the published CLI installs reliably through npx.
- 8bcc21d: Use a compact popover for the shared language picker so icon-only chrome can style it reliably.

## 0.79.19

### Patch Changes

- 92876ad: Use a compact popover for the shared language picker so icon-only chrome can style it reliably.

## 0.79.18

### Patch Changes

- a6492db: Quiet app-shell divider lines, taller center headers, and soften raised drawer/card surfaces in dark mode.
- a6492db: Save legacy key setup requests to scoped DB secrets instead of writing deployment env vars, and let file upload providers resolve request-scoped credentials.
- a6492db: Add a reusable settings tab shell and let team settings hide their duplicate panel title.

## 0.79.17

### Patch Changes

- fed6702: Polish shared shell drawer edge borders during depth transitions.

## 0.79.16

### Patch Changes

- 5bf3efe: Fix Cloudflare Pages worker builds for content actions that import Node built-in helpers, and refine shared shell depth styling.

## 0.79.15

### Patch Changes

- 4a73032: Make shared agent and default navigation drawers feel recessed behind rounded app content.

- 6598a72: Polish Traditional Chinese localization wording for Taiwan users.

## 0.79.13

### Patch Changes

- d47bfcb: Document the Clips embedded bug-report workflow.
- d47bfcb: Avoid pulling Node-only server exports and edge-incompatible optional packages into Cloudflare Pages worker bundles.

## 0.79.12

### Patch Changes

- aec5806: Keep Cloudflare Pages workers under the bundle size limit by serving app HTML from a build-time static shell.

## 0.79.11

### Patch Changes

- 72c1b3d: Fix Cloudflare Pages worker builds for apps with browser screenshot helpers.

## 0.79.10

### Patch Changes

- 7e19ed6: Return plain string action results with a JSON content type so browser action clients can parse successful responses.

## 0.79.9

### Patch Changes

- ca677a0: Reduce noisy error capture for expected provider connection failures and transient chat recovery probes.

## 0.79.8

### Patch Changes

- 4984f2b: Fail A2A agent tasks that end on terminal run errors without a final response, and keep app-native artifact actions ahead of generic extension creation in agent prompts.
- 4984f2b: Centralize agent chat request context resolution so foreground and durable background workers share owner, org, timezone, and background-run setup, harden hosted credential fallback detection, and support compressed session replay uploads.

## 0.79.7

### Patch Changes

- b7cfefe: Remove the temporary durable-background-worker hang-localizer diagnostics from the agent chat setup hot path. The analytics worker-stall bug they were added to debug is fixed and verified in prod, so the ~7 extra awaited DB round-trips per durable run setup (and their 8s-hang risk under DB stress) are no longer needed. The lasting fix and observability — the `worker_stage` column, cheap fire-and-forget `workerStep` markers, `readBackgroundRunClaim`, and the centralized request-context resolution — are retained.

## 0.79.6

### Patch Changes

- 06da8c6: Fix an SSR crash (`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `templates/default/app/i18n/en-US.js`) in consuming apps. The compiled client i18n module reached into `src/templates`, which ships as verbatim copy-only scaffolding (`.ts` only, never compiled to `.js` in `dist`), so Node's strict ESM resolver failed during SSR even though Vite's on-the-fly client transform worked. The default English catalog used for translation fallbacks now lives in a real compiled source module (`src/localization/default-messages.ts` → `dist/localization/default-messages.js`). A postbuild guard imports the SSR-critical entry points under Node's ESM resolver to prevent regressions.

## 0.79.5

### Patch Changes

- f35bd34: fix(agent): resolve the org from the owner email for the cookieless durable background worker. The worker has the run owner (seeded via OWNER_CONTEXT_KEY) but no session, so getSession()/getOrgContext() left orgId null — engine resolution then couldn't find the owner's org-scoped Builder credential and fell back to the anthropic default, bailing on the missing key before the worker claimed its run. invokeAgentChatHandler now falls back to resolveOrgIdForEmail(owner) when there's no session org, so the worker resolves the same engine/credential the foreground does.

## 0.79.4

### Patch Changes

- 495e57a: Fix agent chat resolving a null org in cookieless durable background runs, which
  made the agent see and write only `org_id IS NULL` rows while the UI (carrying
  the session) used the real org. The agent could not list or read resources the
  UI showed, and agent-created rows landed outside the user's org. The background
  run already pre-seeds the owner from the run row; org resolution now falls back
  to `resolveOrgIdForEmail(owner)` when there is no session, so the agent and the
  UI scope to the same org-shared data.

## 0.79.3

### Patch Changes

- d64e550: Add zh-TW Traditional Chinese localization support.

## 0.79.2

### Patch Changes

- 53b99c7: fix(agent): run the durable background-function worker inside the run owner's request context (`runWithRequestContext({ userEmail })`). The cookieless `_process-run` worker only seeded the owner for `getOwnerFromEvent`, but engine resolution (`detectEngineFromUserSecrets`) and other owner-scoped reads use `getRequestUserEmail()`/`getRequestOrgId()` from the AsyncLocalStorage request context, which the worker left empty. As a result the worker missed the owner's Builder credential, fell back to the anthropic default, and — when the owner had no stored anthropic key and deploy-credential fallback was blocked (hosted prod) — bailed at the API-key check before ever claiming its run, so durable background runs for such apps (e.g. analytics) only ever completed via the slow foreground inline-recovery. The worker now resolves the same engine/credential the foreground does and claims its run.

## 0.79.1

### Patch Changes

- 43ea142: diag(agent): capture the durable background worker's API-key resolution state (engine, owner resolved, owner key, effective key, deploy-fallback-blocked) just before the anthropic key check. The worker stalls at `post_model_ok` and never reaches `aw_env` — the only exit between them is the anthropic key check's early return, so this pinpoints whether the worker bails for lack of an `effectiveApiKey`.

## 0.79.0

### Minor Changes

- 6e25485: Add Generative UI support for transient and persisted sandboxed inline extensions in chat.

### Patch Changes

- 6e25485: Improve session replay playback and inline extension chat surfaces.
- 6e25485: Teach generated saved extensions to persist reusable user-edited state with extensionData.

## 0.78.9

### Patch Changes

- d2a14ea: Fix MCP App transplant (Claude) rendering the app's 404 page instead of the
  target route. The embed ticket's `targetPath` is `/_agent-native/open?...&to=/plans/<id>`,
  which 302-redirects to the real app route. The transplant followed that redirect
  to fetch the correct SSR HTML, but then called `history.replaceState` with the
  **pre-redirect** location (`/_agent-native/open`) — a server-only framework route
  React Router has no client route for — so hydration threw
  `No route matches URL "/_agent-native/open"` and rendered the app's 404 boundary.
  The transplant now uses the post-redirect `response.url` (the resolved app route,
  e.g. `/plans/<id>`) for `replaceState`, so the hydrated router matches the route.

## 0.78.8

### Patch Changes

- fb735f3: diag(agent): add awaited phase markers (`aw_env`, `aw_presend`, `aw_actions`, `aw_owner`) across the durable background worker's post-`model_done` setup. The awaited `post_model` probe lands (writes work after model resolution), so the worker's stall is a main-flow stall, not a DB hang — these markers advance `worker_stage` to the last phase the main flow actually reached, pinpointing the stall.

## 0.78.7

### Patch Changes

- 61b078a: Preserve resolved user and org context when agent tool calls run actions.

## 0.78.6

### Patch Changes

- 81a7f90: diag(agent): add awaited `post_model_awaited` and `pre_claim` probes in the durable background worker. `worker_stage` stalls at `model_done` even though the code right after is trivial sync; these awaited (withDbTimeout-bounded) writes distinguish a hung bg-fn DB connection right after model resolution (probe never lands) from a later main-flow stall (probe lands, then the stall is downstream).

## 0.78.5

### Patch Changes

- 2a5a74b: diag(agent): add a `worker_stage` column that records the durable background worker's last-reached setup stage independently of the foreground inline-recovery `setup_timings` write, plus early `engine_resolved` / `systemprompt_enter` / `systemprompt_done` markers. `/runs/active` now surfaces `workerStage`, so a worker that stalls before claiming its run is diagnosable (which exact step it reached) without the unreadable Netlify background-function logs.

## 0.78.4

### Patch Changes

- 776041c: Keep mounted app browser bundles and manifests from escaping their app base path.
- 776041c: Keep Nitro/Vite dev servers running when native file watchers hit EMFILE or ENOSPC, and avoid watching generated template metadata directories.

## 0.78.3

### Patch Changes

- a396d62: Resolve MCP tool caller org scope from the verified user email when a token has no explicit org claim, so org-scoped actions return the same resources agents can see in the UI.

## 0.78.2

### Patch Changes

- 8a6522a: fix(agent): make the durable background-function worker reliably claim its run for heavy apps (analytics). Two changes: (1) the per-run context now carries `isBackgroundWorker`, set before the system prompt is built, so template `extraContext`/prompt builders can skip heavy, hang-prone enrichment in the worker — the analytics data-dictionary read+render (which ran eagerly during prompt construction, before any pre-send timeout could arm) is now skipped in the worker, while the foreground keeps the full dictionary; (2) the pre-send context cap now takes thunks instead of eagerly-created promises, so each step runs inside an already-armed timeout (an eager promise could start and stall the event loop before the cap wrapped it) and a stalled step is recorded as `presend_timeout:<label>` for attribution. Foreground behavior is unchanged.

## 0.78.1

### Patch Changes

- 71849f1: Add structured composer reference chips that can be inserted programmatically
  and constrained to one visible value per app-defined slot.
- 71849f1: Forward chat thread footer slots through AgentSidebar so apps can keep live run
  results attached to chat threads.

## 0.78.0

### Minor Changes

- 368e2a7: Add core session replay client primitives and private blob storage abstractions for Agent-Native Analytics.

### Patch Changes

- 368e2a7: Support CID inline attachments in the core email transport.
- 368e2a7: Keep agent sidebar contents at their full open width while desktop sidebars animate in and out, avoiding text reflow during the transition, and hide the page-level New chat action until a chat has actually started.

## 0.77.24

### Patch Changes

- 45e0923: fix(agent): time-cap durable background pre-send context reads so a single hung read can't freeze the worker. Previously a pre-send DB read that hung (rather than erroring) in a background-function worker stalled the run until the foreground inline-recovery grace (~16s), wasting the durable budget and leaving the run un-claimed. Each pre-send step now degrades to a safe default on timeout (background worker only; foreground unchanged), and a rejected step (e.g. message enrichment) falls back instead of failing the whole batch.

## 0.77.23

### Patch Changes

- 7e290b9: Route the durable background-function worker's Neon queries over the stateless
  HTTP transport (`poolQueryViaFetch`) instead of a long-lived WebSocket pool
  connection. A frozen/thawed bg-fn instance can leave the WebSocket half-dead, so
  every query after the first burst stalls on connect()/query() — the analytics
  worker stalled right after model resolution and never claimed its run. The
  foreground keeps the WebSocket pool.
- 7e290b9: Remove the background-worker diagnostic instrumentation added during the
  analytics-freeze investigation (breadcrumb sink route, awaited diag writes,
  per-branch timeout wrappers, dedicated connection, fetch-POST breadcrumbs),
  restoring the clean post-DDL-guard worker hot path. The DDL guard (#1514) and
  background-function pool fix (#1523) — the real fixes — are retained.

## 0.77.22

### Patch Changes

- 072dc01: Remove the background-worker diagnostic instrumentation added during the
  analytics-freeze investigation (breadcrumb sink route, awaited diag writes,
  per-branch timeout wrappers, dedicated connection, fetch-POST breadcrumbs),
  restoring the clean post-DDL-guard worker hot path. The DDL guard (#1514) and
  background-function pool fix (#1523) — the real fixes — are retained.

## 0.77.21

### Patch Changes

- c1f7fe7: DIAGNOSTIC: background-worker breadcrumb sink. The bg fn fire-and-forget POSTs
  its `[bg-presend]` breadcrumbs to a key-gated foreground `/bg-log-sink` route so
  the worker's post-`model_done` setup progress is readable — the worker's own DB
  diag writes stall there and Netlify doesn't surface background-function logs.
  Also disambiguates event-loop-block vs DB-hang (if the POSTs land, the event loop
  is fine). Temporary; removed once the analytics worker freeze is fixed.

## 0.77.20

### Patch Changes

- 97a642e: Stop injecting the `baseUrl` compiler option into scaffolded app tsconfigs. `baseUrl` is deprecated and errors in TypeScript 6 (TS5101/TS5102) and removed in TypeScript 7. The `create` CLI now relies on `paths` (including the `"*": ["./*"]` catch-all) which resolve relative to the project's own tsconfig, fixing `error TS5102: Option 'baseUrl' has been removed` under tsgo / `@typescript/native-preview` in generated starters.

## 0.77.19

### Patch Changes

- 27fc4c2: Route the background-worker's awaited milestone diagnostics through a dedicated
  (non-pooled) DB connection. The pooled connection becomes unusable right after
  the model-resolution block (model_done lands, the next pooled write hangs), so a
  dedicated connection lets the post-model_done milestones land and makes the
  worker's true freeze point visible in /runs/active.

## 0.77.18

### Patch Changes

- 278f171: Make the background-worker's post-`model_done` milestone diagnostics
  (`env_config`, `context_all`, `action_tool_setup`, `owner_thread`, `prestart`)
  AWAITED writes instead of fire-and-forget. A blocked event loop can't flush
  fire-and-forget async writes, so they never landed once the worker froze; an
  awaited write lands while the loop is still running, so the last milestone
  visible in `/runs/active` pinpoints exactly where the worker freezes.

## 0.77.17

### Patch Changes

- 6c65e7f: Show a Plan signup note for switching `/visual-plan` to local-files mode.
- 6c65e7f: Allow apps to filter the broad action-event query invalidation from `useDbSync`.
- 6c65e7f: Keep standalone scaffold installs stable when fresh Sentry transitive packages are published.

## 0.77.16

### Patch Changes

- 02af11c: Extend the background-worker pre-send instrumentation: also time out the required
  suspect branches (system prompt / `extraContext`, enriched message) and record
  which branch hit its timeout/error fallback into the run's setup diagnostic
  (`to=...` in `setupDetail`). The hanging op is then identifiable via
  `/runs/active` even when the Netlify function-log drain is unreadable, and the
  timeout lets the worker claim past a stuck required read.

## 0.77.15

### Patch Changes

- d5ec2d0: Diagnostic + defensive instrumentation for the durable background-agent worker's
  pre-send setup. Adds stdout breadcrumbs (`bgLog`, gated on the worker → Netlify
  function logs, independent of DB writes which stall in the failing case) across
  the post-`model_done` / pre-claim sequence and each parallel pre-send branch
  (enrich, loop settings, system prompt, view-screen, url, selection, files
  inventory) with start/done/error/timeout. The OPTIONAL context reads
  (view-screen, url, selection, files) now race a short timeout with a safe `""`
  fallback so one stuck read cannot block the worker from reaching
  `claimBackgroundRun`. Used to localize the analytics-only worker freeze that the
  DB-based diagnostic can't see.

## 0.77.14

### Patch Changes

- b83184b: Fix durable background-agent workers freezing during pre-send setup on apps with
  large action surfaces (e.g. analytics). The background-function Neon pool was
  capped at 2 connections (same as the foreground serverless), but the agent's
  pre-send setup fires ~6 concurrent DB reads — that burst exhausted the 2-slot
  pool and a stalled connection froze the worker right after `model_done`, so it
  never claimed and the foreground fell back to inline (~17s) every turn. The bg
  worker is a single process per run, so it now uses a larger pool (8); the
  many-instance foreground serverless pool stays at 2 to avoid Neon's connection
  cap.

## 0.77.13

### Patch Changes

- c90f02a: Diagnostic-only: in the background-agent worker, emit a `presend:<settled-set>`
  breadcrumb as each parallel pre-send promise settles, so a worker that freezes
  between `env_config` and `context_all` reveals the exact hanging step (system
  prompt, view-screen, app-state reads, etc.) via the name missing from the last
  breadcrumb. No behavior change.

## 0.77.12

### Patch Changes

- 67dba9b: Sync builder-agent-native-starter toolchain files (React Router config, Vite config, server plugins, etc.) alongside the manifest so dependency bumps from templates/chat do not leave the starter in a broken state. Standalone UI scaffolds re-declare tsconfig `paths` and `baseUrl` for `@/*` resolution; headless scaffolds omit `baseUrl` for TS 6 tsgo compatibility. Netlify post-process now rewrites unindented template build commands.

## 0.77.11

### Patch Changes

- 7560a7c: Clear collaborative awareness state immediately when an editor leaves a document.

## 0.77.10

### Patch Changes

- 12545bc: Keep standalone scaffold installs stable when fresh Sentry transitive packages are published.

## 0.77.9

### Patch Changes

- 3eeec7f: Generalize the `ensureTable()` DDL guard to ALL on-demand schema-init paths
  (~36 stores: agent run-store, application-state, chat-threads, usage,
  oauth-tokens, resources, observability, integrations, provider-api, mcp,
  workspace-connections, extensions, audit, harness, a2a, notifications,
  browser-sessions, auth/sessions, agent-teams run-queue, better-auth, and more).

  Every `ensureTable` now probes `information_schema`/`pg_indexes` before issuing
  `CREATE TABLE`/`ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN`/`CREATE INDEX`, so the already-migrated
  hot path takes NO `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock on Postgres. Any DDL that must run is
  wrapped in a transaction-scoped `SET LOCAL lock_timeout` (never leaks onto the
  pooled connection), and a swallowed lock-timeout triggers a RE-PROBE: if the
  schema is still missing it throws (so the per-store init memo rejects and retries)
  rather than memoizing init success against absent schema. This fixes
  background-function (durable agent-chat) workers hanging indefinitely on the
  first-touch DDL lock of any table on shared Neon. Shared helpers live in
  `db/ddl-guard.ts` (`ensureSchemaObject`/`ensureTableExists`/`ensureColumnExists`/
  `ensureIndexExists`). Postgres behavior is unchanged. CREATE SQL that
  references `intType()` is built at runtime, not module scope.

## 0.77.8

### Patch Changes

- 7dc2828: Guard on-demand `ensureTable()` schema-init so the already-migrated path takes no
  `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock on Postgres. The app-secrets (`app_secrets`) and `settings`
  stores now probe `information_schema`/`pg_indexes` first (plain reads, no lock) and
  issue `CREATE`/`ALTER`/`CREATE INDEX` only when something is actually missing; any
  DDL that must run is wrapped in a transaction-scoped `SET LOCAL lock_timeout` so a
  contended lock fails fast instead of hanging (and never leaks onto the pooled
  connection). This fixes background-function workers hanging indefinitely on
  first-touch schema DDL behind a concurrent connection on shared Neon — observed as
  durable agent-chat workers stalling right after auth and never claiming the run.
  Postgres behavior is unchanged. Adds a shared `db/ddl-guard.ts` helper
  (`pgTableExists`/`pgColumnExists`/`pgIndexExists`/`runGuardedDdl`). Also adds
  diagnostic-only worker setup sub-stage breadcrumbs to localize such stalls.

## 0.77.7

### Patch Changes

- e5bdcb3: Paginate the All Chats history client so older conversations can be loaded without truncating the history list.
- e5bdcb3: Drop benign reasonless browser AbortError events from Sentry reporting.
- e5bdcb3: Repair duplicate persisted chat message ids during thread normalization.
- e5bdcb3: Ensure hosted template apps can inject Google Analytics from Netlify build-time configuration.
- e5bdcb3: Normalize email casing when resolving shareable-resource ownership and user shares, and let resources opt into owner access across active-org drift.
- e5bdcb3: Re-check current LLM connection status before a stale missing-credentials event can keep chat locked after reconnecting Builder, and prevent page chat surfaces from rendering sidebar settings in the main content area.
- e5bdcb3: Allow browser Sentry initialization to build a DSN from Vite-exposed Sentry client key, project id, and ingest host env vars when runtime config injection is unavailable.

## 0.77.6

### Patch Changes

- 1fab043: Localize shared extension sidebar chrome and changelog labels/dates.

## 0.77.5

### Patch Changes

- 355be37: Add diagnostic-only worker-side progressive setup-stage diagnostics
  (`worker_setup_step`) to localize where a durable background worker hangs between
  `auth_passed` and `claimBackgroundRun`. For the background worker only (gated on
  `isBackgroundWorker`, using the marker's early-available runId), emit the last
  setup stage reached — `db_request_ctx`, `env_config`, `context_all`,
  `action_tool_setup`, `owner_thread`, `prestart` — as the run's `diag_stage`, so a
  worker that stalls leaves a breadcrumb at the stage it stopped in. Best-effort and
  fire-and-forget; no control-flow change.

## 0.77.4

### Patch Changes

- 71db1e0: Improve localization coverage by localizing framework error screens and docs UI surfaces, and add a baseline-aware i18n guard that fails on new raw visible UI strings.
- 71db1e0: Localize shared feedback and docs block chrome while tightening the i18n raw-literal guard.
- 71db1e0: Translate remaining Getting Started embedded docs copy and guard localized docs against newly copied English block strings.

## 0.77.3

### Patch Changes

- 4c1e290: Add diagnostic-only pre-`startRun` setup-timing instrumentation to the agent-chat
  handler. Captures wall-clock offsets from handler entry through the work done
  before the agent loop starts — body parse, request prep, system-prompt build,
  screen context, the parallel context-collection `Promise.all`, action/tool
  conversion, and thread data — and emits them as a `setup_timings` run diagnostic
  (readable via the run's `diag_stage`). No behavior change; best-effort and
  fire-and-forget. It lets us localize which setup bucket dominates pre-run latency
  on heavy apps — e.g. analytics, whose >25s setup currently exceeds the durable
  claim grace — and runs on both the inline and background-worker paths, so the
  breakdown can be measured with durable left OFF.

## 0.77.2

### Patch Changes

- 6d04136: MCP Apps: render inline embeds in a nested child iframe instead of transplanting
  the app document on hosts where transplant breaks. Transplant boots the app via
  cross-origin dynamic `import()` inside the host's opaque-origin sandbox, which
  strict hosts block (blank "Loading app").
  - `ui/*` bridge hosts (Cursor, Codex) now render in a nested child iframe.
  - ChatGPT now uses its controlled nested frame: `isChatGptSandboxHost` was
    removed from `shouldTransplantAppDocument`, which had forced ChatGPT to
    transplant and hang blank.

  Claude keeps the transplant path; `embedMode: "transplant"` still forces it.

## 0.77.1

### Patch Changes

- e3a084f: Durable background agent-chat: wait adaptively for a slow-but-alive worker to
  claim a dispatched run, instead of abandoning it and recovering inline. The
  foreground waits a base grace for the background worker to claim; heavy apps
  (e.g. analytics) can take longer than that to build the system prompt and load
  actions before claiming, so their worker lost the race every time and the
  15-minute background budget went unused (observed in prod: the run stalls at
  `auth_passed`, then recovers via `foreground_inline_recovery`).

  The circuit-breaker now keeps polling past the base grace ONLY while the worker
  is provably alive and still in setup — its `diag_stage` (parsed from the stored
  JSON payload) is `auth_passed`/`worker_entered` but it has not claimed yet. A
  dead handoff never records those stages, so it still recovers inline at the base
  grace; a worker that recorded a pre-claim failure (`route_threw` / `worker_threw`
  / `auth_failed`) recovers inline immediately. The extension is bounded by the
  unclaimed-run reaper's own window, measured from the run's liveness
  (`COALESCE(heartbeat_at, started_at)`), so the foreground always claims the run
  inline just before `reapUnclaimedBackgroundRun` could fire — immune to dispatch
  latency between insert and the start of polling. The claim itself still happens
  right before the agent loop, so all existing fast-recovery and duplicate-delivery
  guarantees are preserved.

## 0.77.0

### Minor Changes

- dd40496: Add a `"none"` block `editSurface` so a registered block can render its `Read` view in edit mode with no data form and no corner edit (pencil) button — for blocks whose whole-block operations live in the editor chrome/menu rather than a generated or custom editor.
- 2a03c35: Upgrade framework and template React Router support to v8 and require the v8 runtime baselines.

### Patch Changes

- 2a03c35: Animate the standard agent sidebar drawer when it opens and closes.
- 2a03c35: Preserve signed Builder connect callback query parameters on mounted framework routes so docs and other app surfaces can complete Connect Builder flows reliably.
- 2a03c35: Durable background diagnostics: preserve the background-function worker's last
  `diag_stage` (`route_entered` / `auth_failed` / etc., or `none` if it never
  reached the route) in the foreground circuit-breaker's
  `foreground_inline_recovery` detail instead of overwriting it. This makes a
  silent worker death diagnosable from `/runs/active` without reading the
  unreadable Netlify background-function logs. `readBackgroundRunClaim` now also
  returns `diagStage`.
- 2a03c35: Durable background agent runs: add a foreground **circuit-breaker** so a dead
  background worker can no longer break chat. A Netlify async background function
  returns `202` the instant it enqueues the invocation, but the worker may never
  execute — e.g. the generated function wrapper fails to import `./main.mjs` or
  hand off to the Nitro `_process-run` route, so it never reaches
  `claimBackgroundRun` and the run is reaped as "worker never claimed the run".
  After a successful dispatch the foreground now polls briefly for the worker to
  actually claim the run; if it doesn't within the grace window, the turn is
  recovered **inline** (the same safe atomic-claim path used for a fast dispatch
  failure), so a dead worker degrades to a working synchronous turn instead of a
  reaped failure. Also harden the generated background-function wrapper to pass
  Netlify's `context` through to the Nitro handler and wrap the handoff in
  try/catch so a pre-route failure is logged loudly instead of silently swallowed
  behind the async 202.
- 2a03c35: Add a linkable API reference section for authenticated extension data routes to the Extensions docs.
- 2a03c35: Keep note-only FileTree file rows inline without disclosure chevrons, truncating long notes and showing the hover tooltip only when the text is actually clipped.
- 2a03c35: Link the first actions mention in Getting Started to the actions docs.
- 2a03c35: Bundle an Arabic-capable OG image font so localized Arabic docs previews render real text instead of missing-glyph boxes.
- 2a03c35: Show a New chat button on full-page Ask chat surfaces with visible conversation tabs after a conversation starts.
- 2a03c35: Prevent default-closed agent sidebars from reopening because of stale global sidebar state.
- 2a03c35: Add an `agentNative()` Vite plugin preset so app `vite.config.ts` files can use
  Vite's native `defineConfig` while keeping Agent-Native framework defaults.
- 2a03c35: Preserve first-touch referral attribution through email and Google OAuth signups, and make Postgres parameter conversion ignore question marks inside SQL literals.
- 2a03c35: Stop showing previous scoped chats in the empty chat state.
- 2a03c35: Let the agent composer model picker shrink to its content instead of forcing a tall popover.
- 2a03c35: Make PR visual recap comments report screenshot failures explicitly and cache-bust embedded screenshot URLs per workflow run so GitHub does not reuse stale image proxy entries.

## 0.76.14

### Patch Changes

- 64f90ca: Docs: add a "Durable Background Runs" page documenting the durable background
  agent-chat system — the two-function model (`server` + `server-agent-background`),
  what runs in the background worker and how it's gated, the dispatch lifecycle +
  foreground circuit-breaker, and Netlify cost/tradeoffs.

## 0.76.13

### Patch Changes

- d12772c: Durable background agent-chat: raise the foreground circuit-breaker's claim grace
  from 8s to 15s (`BACKGROUND_CLAIM_GRACE_MS`). Heavy apps (observed on analytics
  in prod) take longer than 8s to cold-start the background function and reach
  `claimBackgroundRun`, so the foreground recovered inline every time — adding ~8s
  latency per turn and never using the 15-minute background budget. 15s lets the
  slow-but-alive workers win the claim while staying well within the foreground's
  ~40s soft-timeout; a genuinely dead worker still falls back to inline.

## 0.76.9

### Patch Changes

- bbbd01a: Durable background agent-chat: actually run the background worker. The
  self-dispatch into the Netlify background function is cookieless (HMAC-only), so
  the worker had no session and `resolveOwnerContext` threw 401 "Unauthenticated"
  before it could even claim the run — every durable run died at the route
  boundary (`route_threw`) and only completed via the foreground circuit-breaker's
  inline recovery, never using the 15-minute background budget. The `_process-run`
  route now resolves the owner securely from the run's chat thread
  (`getRunOwnerEmail(runId)` — DB-derived from the HMAC-signed run row, not the
  forgeable request body) and pre-seeds the owner context, so the background
  worker runs with the correct authenticated owner and the full background budget.

## 0.76.8

- fd78baa: Animate the standard agent sidebar drawer when it opens and closes.
- fd78baa: Durable background diagnostics: preserve the background-function worker's last
  `diag_stage` (`route_entered` / `auth_failed` / etc., or `none` if it never
  reached the route) in the foreground circuit-breaker's
  `foreground_inline_recovery` detail instead of overwriting it. This makes a
  silent worker death diagnosable from `/runs/active` without reading the
  unreadable Netlify background-function logs. `readBackgroundRunClaim` now also
  returns `diagStage`.
- fd78baa: Durable background agent runs: add a foreground **circuit-breaker** so a dead
  background worker can no longer break chat. A Netlify async background function
  returns `202` the instant it enqueues the invocation, but the worker may never
  execute — e.g. the generated function wrapper fails to import `./main.mjs` or
  hand off to the Nitro `_process-run` route, so it never reaches
  `claimBackgroundRun` and the run is reaped as "worker never claimed the run".
  After a successful dispatch the foreground now polls briefly for the worker to
  actually claim the run; if it doesn't within the grace window, the turn is
  recovered **inline** (the same safe atomic-claim path used for a fast dispatch
  failure), so a dead worker degrades to a working synchronous turn instead of a
  reaped failure. Also harden the generated background-function wrapper to pass
  Netlify's `context` through to the Nitro handler and wrap the handoff in
  try/catch so a pre-route failure is logged loudly instead of silently swallowed
  behind the async 202.
- fd78baa: Add an `agentNative()` Vite plugin preset so app `vite.config.ts` files can use
  Vite's native `defineConfig` while keeping Agent-Native framework defaults.

### Patch Changes

- dbb5cac: Durable background diagnostics: preserve the background-function worker's last
  `diag_stage` (`route_entered` / `auth_failed` / etc., or `none` if it never
  reached the route) in the foreground circuit-breaker's
  `foreground_inline_recovery` detail instead of overwriting it. This makes a
  silent worker death diagnosable from `/runs/active` without reading the
  unreadable Netlify background-function logs. `readBackgroundRunClaim` now also
  returns `diagStage`.

## 0.76.6

### Patch Changes

- c294aaa: Expand localized UI coverage across core client surfaces, Dispatch chrome, scheduling controls, templates, and the docs site.
- c294aaa: Document the authenticated extension data API and enforce extension sharing
  roles server-side for direct `/_agent-native/extensions/data/*` calls.

## 0.76.4

### Patch Changes

- 6067f27: Fix right-to-left (`ar-SA`) layout in shared framework chrome. Physical directional CSS in the agent panel, command menu, language picker, shadcn `ui/*` primitives, settings/composer/org/sharing/onboarding panels, and the agent-conversation/blocks/rich-markdown styles is converted to logical utilities (`ms`/`me`, `ps`/`pe`, `start`/`end`, `text-start`/`text-end`, `border-s`/`border-e`), and directional icons are mirrored with `rtl:-scale-x-100`. No change to left-to-right rendering (logical utilities are identical to physical in LTR).

## 0.76.3

### Patch Changes

- 57e72bb: Correct stale "default-on" doc comments in `durable-background.ts` and
  `deploy/build.ts` so they reflect that durable background agent runs are now
  opt-in (default-off). Comment-only; no behavior change.

## 0.76.2

### Patch Changes

- 93c06b0: Make durable background agent runs opt-in (default-off) again. Both the runtime
  gate (`isFlagEnabled` in durable-background.ts) and the deploy-time `-background`
  emit gate (`isDurableBackgroundDeployEnabled` in deploy/build.ts) now default to
  OFF when `AGENT_CHAT_DURABLE_BACKGROUND` is unset; an app opts in only with an
  explicit truthy value (`true`/`1`/`yes`/`on`). A premature fleet-wide default-on
  caused real-user incidents (apps hit "Failed to dispatch background run" + chat
  stalls) because the async background-function worker path is not yet proven
  end-to-end and the deploy-time env opt-out is not reliably baked into a given
  deploy. Re-enable default-on only after the 15-min background-function worker is
  verified live in production.

## 0.76.1

### Patch Changes

- 50f32ff: Make durable-background agent-chat worker failures diagnosable from the client
  and harden recovery when the background worker never starts.

  A durable-background run is dispatched into a Netlify `-background` function,
  which acks asynchronously with a 202. If that worker then dies silently (its
  logs are not readable from the build tooling), the run would just time out with
  no clue why, and because dispatch already returned 202 the existing fast-fail
  inline fallback never engaged — so the run errored opaquely.

  Diagnostics (readable WITHOUT bg-fn logs). The `_process-run` worker pipeline
  now records the last reached stage onto the run row (`agent_runs.diag_stage`, a
  compact JSON `{stage,detail?,at}`) via the new best-effort `recordRunDiagnostic`:
  route entered, HMAC auth pass/fail (recorded onto the run BEFORE the 401/503 is
  returned, including whether `A2A_SECRET` is present in the bg-fn isolate),
  worker entered (with the resolved `runsInBackgroundFunction` value), claim
  win/lose, worker loop started, and any thrown error. `/runs/active?threadId=`
  (and `listRunsForThread`) now surface `dispatchMode` and `diagStage`, so the
  next prod run's death cause is readable straight from the client.

  Recovery (covers "202 acked but worker never started"). A background-dispatched
  run that is still unclaimed (`dispatch_mode = 'background'`, never flipped to
  `background-processing`) past a tight 25s grace is reaped early and recoverably
  with the new `background_worker_never_started` error code (the wide 90s window
  only exists to protect a CLAIMED, cold-starting worker — an unclaimed run has no
  worker to protect). The `/runs/active` read path attempts this recovery before
  the generic stale reaper, so a silent worker death surfaces as a recoverable
  error the client can re-drive instead of hanging for 90s.

  Also fixes a latent gate: `/_agent-native/agent-chat/_process-run` now bypasses
  the session-auth guard (mirroring the agent-teams processor). The self-dispatch
  carries only an HMAC Bearer token and no session cookie, so without the bypass
  the worker was 401'd before it could authenticate and claim the run.

- 50f32ff: Tighten bundled visual plan wireframe guidance so agents use literal spacing,
  pad root containers, and choose feature-cloud layouts for abundance-style
  marketing sections.

## 0.76.0

### Minor Changes

- 16356c2: Add framework localization support with shared i18n providers, locale preference actions, catalog loading helpers, guards, and docs.
- 16356c2: Add a framework helper for opening the agent settings tab and standardize app settings access in Dispatch.

## 0.75.5

### Patch Changes

- 25802f2: Durable background agent-chat runs now reach Netlify's 15-min async function via
  the function's DEFAULT url (`/.netlify/functions/<name>`) with NO custom
  `config.path` and NO catch-all patch — the doc-correct approach per the Netlify
  docs.

  Every Netlify function is reachable at `/.netlify/functions/<name>` by default;
  a custom `config.path` REMOVES that default url. The build now emits the
  background function into the scanned dir
  (`.netlify/functions-internal/server-agent-background`, or per-app
  `<app>-agent-background` for workspaces), sharing the same `main.mjs` bundle,
  with `export const config = { background: true, ... }` and NO custom path. The
  function therefore keeps its default url, and `background: true` makes any
  invocation of that url asynchronous (immediate 202 ack, 15-min budget). The
  Nitro `server` function's `/*` catch-all already excludes `/.netlify/*`, so the
  default-url namespace is never shadowed by the synchronous function — there is
  nothing to patch.

  The function entry rewrites the incoming pathname to the framework
  `_process-run` route (base-path-prefixed for workspaces) before delegating to
  Nitro, preserving the method, all headers (the HMAC `Authorization: Bearer` the
  plugin verifies), and the body. It also sets
  `globalThis.__AGENT_NATIVE_BACKGROUND_RUNTIME__ = true` at cold start so the
  worker takes the 15-min soft-timeout. The foreground self-dispatch resolves the
  function's default url on hosted Netlify (per-app name from
  `AGENT_NATIVE_WORKSPACE_APP_ID`), and `fireInternalDispatch` strips the app base
  path for `/.netlify/*` targets so the request reaches the host-root function
  url. Off-Netlify (local dev, `netlify dev`, non-Netlify hosts), the foreground
  dispatches to the framework process-run route, handled inline by the same
  in-process catch-all.

  This supersedes the earlier attempt that gave the function a custom
  `config.path` (the framework route) plus a `server` `excludedPath` patch — that
  custom path was not honored as a route in production (a probe of
  `POST /_agent-native/agent-chat/_process-run` returned 404). The graceful inline
  40s fallback on a dispatch fast-fail is unchanged.

## 0.75.4

### Patch Changes

- dbfbe42: Preserve starter-only manifest fields when syncing builder-agent-native-starter from templates/chat.

## 0.75.3

### Patch Changes

- 8a00851: Durable background agent-chat runs now reach Netlify's 15-min async function by
  emitting the background function INTO the scanned functions dir with a real
  `config.path`, and excluding that path from the Nitro `server` `/*` catch-all so
  the match is unambiguous.

  Grounded in the real Netlify build output: Nitro's `netlify` preset writes no
  `netlify.toml` and no redirects — the `/*` catch-all is an in-code Functions API
  v2 `config.path: "/*"` on `.netlify/functions-internal/server/server.mjs`.
  Netlify scans exactly the configured `functionsDirectory`
  (`.netlify/functions-internal`); `.netlify/functions/` is the build OUTPUT dir
  (where `@netlify/build` later writes the zips + `manifest.json`) and is never
  scanned. On CI, Netlify reads each scanned function's `export const config` to
  build the manifest routes — so per-file `background`/`path` config is honored.

  The build now emits the background function into
  `.netlify/functions-internal/server-agent-background` (the scanned dir), sharing
  the same `main.mjs` bundle, with `export const config = { background: true, path:
"/_agent-native/agent-chat/_process-run" }`. It also appends that path to the
  `server` function's `config.excludedPath`, so the `/*` catch-all no longer
  matches the process-run route. Netlify evaluates serverless functions before
  redirects, so a POST to the framework process-run route matches only the async
  background function (immediate 202 ack, 15-min budget) — never the synchronous
  `server` catch-all. The entry sets
  `globalThis.__AGENT_NATIVE_BACKGROUND_RUNTIME__ = true` at cold start and
  normalizes the request path before delegating to Nitro, preserving the method,
  all headers (the HMAC `Authorization: Bearer` the plugin verifies), and the body.

  This supersedes the two earlier approaches that failed in production: emitting
  into `functions-internal` with a `config.path` but WITHOUT excluding it from the
  `/*` catch-all (both functions matched the path; the synchronous `server`
  catch-all won, returning a sync 401 instead of a 202), and emitting a standalone
  function into `.netlify/functions/` (never scanned, returned 404). The foreground
  self-dispatch now always targets the framework process-run route on every host
  via `resolveAgentChatProcessRunDispatchPath`. The graceful inline 40s fallback on
  a dispatch fast-fail is unchanged.

## 0.75.2

### Patch Changes

- 4b3543d: Durable background agent-chat runs now actually receive Netlify's 15-min async
  budget by reaching a STANDALONE background function at its DIRECT url, bypassing
  Nitro's synchronous `/*` catch-all.

  The previous emit wrote the background function into `.netlify/functions-internal`
  with a custom `config.path` of the `_process-run` route. A custom `config.path`
  makes a function reachable ONLY at that path (not at its default function url),
  `functions-internal` is not exposed at a default url, and Netlify routed
  `/_agent-native/agent-chat/_process-run` to the synchronous Nitro `server`
  catch-all instead — so the worker was capped at the ~60s wall and degraded to
  40s-chunked runs (confirmed live: a POST to the process-run path returned a
  synchronous 401 from the handler rather than a 202 async ack).

  The build now emits a standalone function into the STANDARD
  `.netlify/functions/server-agent-background` dir with `background: true` and NO
  custom `path`, so Netlify exposes it at `/.netlify/functions/server-agent-background`
  and invokes it asynchronously (immediate 202 ack, 15-min budget). Its entry sets
  `globalThis.__AGENT_NATIVE_BACKGROUND_RUNTIME__ = true` at cold start and rewrites
  the incoming request path back to the `_process-run` route before delegating to
  the Nitro handler, preserving the method, all headers (the HMAC
  `Authorization: Bearer` the plugin verifies survives the rewrite), and the body.
  The foreground self-dispatch (and server-driven continuation chunks) now target
  that direct url on hosted Netlify via a shared `resolveAgentChatProcessRunDispatchPath`
  helper, and stay on the framework route everywhere else. The graceful inline
  40s fallback on a dispatch fast-fail is unchanged.

## 0.75.1

### Patch Changes

- 98b89e2: Durable background agent-chat runs now actually receive Netlify's 15-min async
  budget. The emitted `-background` function declared a custom `config.path` but
  omitted `background: true`, so Netlify served it SYNCHRONOUSLY (~60s) — the
  `config` object overrides the legacy `-background` filename convention — and the
  durable worker was capped at the 60s wall (it degraded to 40s-chunked runs and
  never used the 15-min budget). The emit now sets `background: true` (immediate
  202 ack + 15-min execution) and force-marks the background runtime in the
  function entry so the worker reliably takes the ~13-min soft-timeout regardless
  of the deployed Lambda name. Root cause confirmed with a live prod routing probe
  (POST to the process-run path returned a synchronous 401 from the handler
  instead of a 202 async ack).

## 0.75.0

### Minor Changes

- 1272755: Durable background agent-chat runs now complete cleanly instead of looping at
  the 60s Netlify wall.
  - The Netlify `-background` function (15-min async budget) is now emitted by
    default. The deploy gates (`isDurableBackgroundDeployEnabled` in
    `deploy/build.ts` and `deploy/workspace-deploy.ts`) are inverted to default-ON
    to match the runtime gate — unset/empty means enabled; opt out with a falsy
    `AGENT_CHAT_DURABLE_BACKGROUND` (`false`/`0`/`no`/`off`). This makes the chat
    `_process-run` self-dispatch land on the real 15-min async function, so the
    worker runs with its full budget (and likely fixes the app-specific dispatch
    fast-fail, since the self-POST now hits an instant-202 async function).
  - The run soft-timeout is now tied to the REAL function budget rather than
    merely "I am the background worker." A new `isInBackgroundFunctionRuntime()`
    guard (the Lambda function name ends in `-background`) gates the ~13-min
    soft-timeout. A worker that lands on the regular ~60s function — or the
    graceful inline fallback running in the foreground ~60s function — keeps the
    ~40s soft-timeout and checkpoints before the hard wall instead of overshooting
    and re-dispatching in a loop.
  - Server-driven continuation stays on for every durable worker so a run survives
    the client disconnecting (closed tab): a worker on the regular ~60s function (a
    Netlify routing miss, or a non-Netlify host with no `-background` function)
    self-chains 40s chunks, while a worker in a real `-background` function chains
    ~13-min chunks. Only the per-chunk budget differs by function type; the
    continuation is always server-driven.

## 0.74.0

### Minor Changes

- 4a0d3c4: Durable background agent runs are robust again, and **on by default** for hosted apps.
  - **Graceful inline fallback (the safety fix).** When the foreground turn can't
    hand off to a background worker — the HMAC self-dispatch self-POST fails fast,
    e.g. a connection error or a non-2xx returned within the settle window — the
    agent-chat handler no longer breaks the chat with
    `Failed to dispatch background run`. It now degrades to a normal synchronous
    (inline) run, reusing the already-inserted run row. The run is claimed
    atomically (`claimBackgroundRun`, a conditional `dispatch_mode: background →
background-processing` UPDATE) before running inline, so the SQL atomic claim
    is the single owner — a delayed background delivery that arrives afterward
    loses the claim and no-ops, and the run can never double-execute. A dispatch
    that _did_ land (so a worker already owns the run) still streams the worker's
    events instead of running a second copy.
  - **Default-on, safely.** `AGENT_CHAT_DURABLE_BACKGROUND` is now opt-out for
    hosted apps: unset/empty/unknown counts as enabled; opt a specific app back
    out with an explicit falsy value (`false`/`0`/`no`/`off`). The gate still
    composes with the existing guards, so a run only goes durable when the runtime
    is hosted/serverless **and** `A2A_SECRET` is configured — local dev and
    unconfigured apps stay on the synchronous inline path unchanged. Default-on is
    safe precisely because a failed dispatch degrades to a working inline run. The
    Netlify 15-min `-background` function emit (`isDurableBackgroundDeployEnabled`)
    remains opt-in until its path is separately verified; with it off, the
    default-on baseline runs the worker through the standard function and
    server-chains continuations.
  - **More diagnosable dispatch errors.** Self-dispatch failures now log the
    resolved base URL so a failure tied to which host the self-POST targets
    (custom domain vs deploy URL) is visible in logs. The URL resolution order is
    unchanged (it matches the working A2A/agent-teams self-dispatch paths).

### Patch Changes

- 4a0d3c4: Show numbered annotation markers in the annotated-code gutter, matching the diff
  annotation affordance while preserving the hover popover behavior.
- 4a0d3c4: Clarify Builder code-change handoff fallbacks when cloud agents are unavailable.

## 0.73.0

### Minor Changes

- d684bbf: Durable background agent runs are now **on by default** for hosted apps. Previously the `AGENT_CHAT_DURABLE_BACKGROUND` flag was opt-in (off unless set truthy); it is now opt-out — unset means enabled, and an app disables it with an explicit falsy value (`AGENT_CHAT_DURABLE_BACKGROUND=false`).

  The gate still composes with the existing guards, so a run only goes durable when the runtime is hosted/serverless **and** `A2A_SECRET` is configured — local dev and unconfigured apps stay on the synchronous inline path unchanged. Default-on uses the server-driven agnostic continuation path (verified in prod: long multi-step runs complete past the 40s soft-timeout with no thrash and no int4 overflow). The Netlify 15-min `-background` function emit (`isDurableBackgroundDeployEnabled`) remains opt-in until its path is separately verified.

### Patch Changes

- d684bbf: Clarify the Clips "agent-readable clips" docs so the "see and hear" promise is
  accurate: frame-viewing works in any image-capable agent (ChatGPT, Claude Code,
  Cursor, Codex, MCP-connected agents), while text-only web chats fall back to the
  transcript and can take an uploaded frame. Verified empirically — ChatGPT fetches
  the JPEG frame URLs and describes the screen; claude.ai's web chat reads the
  transcript only. Docs-only copy change; the agent-context/frame APIs are
  unchanged.
- d684bbf: Add scaffold skill refresh commands for generated Agent-Native apps and workspaces, plus public `@agent-native/skills` status/update forwarding.
- d684bbf: Redesign the Google sign-in preflight notice on the onboarding/sign-in screen
  to match the in-app connect popover: an amber warning-icon chip beside a bold
  heading and muted body copy, with the close affordance moved to the top-right.
  The `googleSignInNotice.body` already accepts a string array, so reassurance
  like "It's safe to continue." now renders on its own line. The Continue /
  Run-locally action buttons no longer wrap their labels (`white-space: nowrap`).
  Purely presentational — the host-gating, Continue, and Run-locally behaviors are
  unchanged.
- d684bbf: Add a secondary hosted-app signup notice linking to the Agent-Native Terms and Privacy Policy.

## 0.72.4

### Patch Changes

- 17b696f: Avoid credentialed cross-origin demo status checks from opaque embedded MCP app frames.
- 17b696f: Mint a fresh MCP App embed session when cached host state contains an expired one-time embed ticket, and keep native MCP host shells alive so they can recover on refresh.
- 17b696f: Handle asset picker selections from opaque MCP App parent frames and wait for native MCP host initialization before forwarding selected asset messages.
- 17b696f: Inject per-request identity tokens for trusted first-party org-scoped remote MCP servers, preserving static headers for third-party remotes.
- 17b696f: Bound MCP client connection and tools/list handshakes so stale org MCP servers do not stall dev-server startup after reloads.

## 0.72.3

### Patch Changes

- 6605885: Add opt-in URL sync for durable chat threads and route chat-first templates (chat, assets, and Dispatch) through `/chat/:threadId` deep links.

## 0.72.2

### Patch Changes

- cc21a1c: Build the audit-redaction test fixture from concatenated parts so Netlify's
  secret scanner no longer flags a literal `sk-` token pattern and blocks the
  deploy.

## 0.72.1

### Patch Changes

- b2a5931: Fix `value "<ms epoch>" is out of range for type integer` aborting agent chat on
  Postgres/Neon at the start of every turn.

  The background-aware stale-run cutoff built SQL like
  `COALESCE(heartbeat_at, started_at) >= (? - CASE WHEN dispatch_mode LIKE
'background%' THEN 90000 ELSE 15000 END)` and bound `Date.now()` to the
  parameter. Postgres infers an untyped parameter's type from its surrounding
  expression, and because the `15000`/`90000` window literals are `int4`, it typed
  the parameter as `int4` too — so a millisecond epoch like `1782295529106`
  overflowed even though every column involved is already `BIGINT`. This is a
  query-level type-inference bug, independent of column types, which is why the
  `widenIntColumnsToBigInt()` shim could never fix it.

  The cutoff now wraps the parameter in `CAST(? AS BIGINT)`, pinning it to int8 so
  the subtraction stays 64-bit. Fixes `tryClaimRunSlot`, `reapIfStale`,
  `reapAllStaleRuns`, and `cleanupOldRuns`, which all share the cutoff.

## 0.72.0

### Minor Changes

- 9a984f2: Add a framework audit log: a durable, complete, access-scoped, append-only record of who mutated what app data, when, from where, and — when it was the agent — in which run. Capture is automatic at the `defineAction` seam (default-on for mutating actions; read-only actions opt in via `audit.onRead`), with credential redaction, agent-vs-human actor attribution, and agent thread/turn linkage. Reads go through two new core actions every app inherits — `list-audit-events` and `get-audit-event` — scoped in SQL to the caller's identity and org. Stored in `agent_audit_log` (provider-agnostic), with a retention purge configurable via `AGENT_NATIVE_AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 365) and a global kill switch `AGENT_NATIVE_AUDIT_ENABLED=false`. Distinct from observability (sampled telemetry) and tracking (fire-and-forget analytics).

### Patch Changes

- 9a984f2: Relax the default `Permissions-Policy` from `camera=()` to `camera=*` so media-capture UI is no longer blocked at the policy level. `camera=()` disabled the camera for the page **and every iframe inside it**, which broke same-page recording UI and the Clips browser extension's camera bubble (injected as a cross-origin iframe, so it can't be re-enabled per-frame). Microphone stays `self`, geolocation and wake-lock stay disabled, and the browser still gates actual camera/mic use behind a per-origin permission prompt — this only removes the policy-level block, not user consent.
- 9a984f2: Fix a chat crash where the agent transcript could fail to render with
  "MessageRepository(performOp/link): A message with the same id already exists in
  the parent tree". Thread repositories whose message list contained a repeated id
  (from optimistic+echo races, streaming reconnect replays, or multi-tab merges)
  were imported into assistant-ui verbatim, and its `MessageRepository` throws on a
  duplicate id. The import path now collapses duplicate ids to their most recent
  copy before handing the repository to assistant-ui, so the throw can't occur. The
  no-duplicate case is an exact no-op, leaving normal threads unchanged.
- 9a984f2: Fix `value "<ms epoch>" is out of range for type integer` on long-lived
  Postgres/Neon databases — most visibly, agent chat failing on **every** prompt.
  Millisecond `Date.now()` timestamps are written into columns that, on databases
  created before the Postgres BIGINT-compatibility shim, are physically 32-bit
  `INTEGER` (int4, max 2,147,483,647); a millisecond epoch like `1782269273204`
  overflows. The source had since switched to `BIGINT`, but `CREATE TABLE IF NOT
EXISTS` can't re-type an existing column, so those databases kept the int4
  column and writes kept failing (`insertRun()` runs at the start of every turn,
  so the agent chat aborted as a `connection_error`).

  Adds a `widenIntColumnsToBigInt()` helper (new module
  `@agent-native/core/db/widen-columns`) that, on Postgres only, widens such
  columns in place to `BIGINT` once via each store's existing `ensureTable()`
  bootstrap. It is idempotent (only ALTERs columns still typed `integer`, so
  already-bigint tables are never rewritten), non-destructive (int4 → int8
  widening), and applies only to Postgres. Applied to the millisecond-timestamp columns
  of `agent_runs`, `agent_tool_ledger`, `chat_threads`, `application_state`,
  `token_usage`, `settings`, `oauth_tokens`, `resources`, `sessions`, and
  `custom_api_providers`. (`staged_datasets` already self-heals via its own
  widener.)

## 0.71.0

### Minor Changes

- 38266fc: Add opt-in durable background agent-chat runs (off by default, host-agnostic). Behind `AGENT_CHAT_DURABLE_BACKGROUND` (active only when hosted AND `A2A_SECRET` is set AND the flag is truthy), a long in-app agent-chat turn is routed through a server-driven background worker via the framework's portable self-dispatch instead of completing synchronously under the ~40s interactive soft-timeout: the foreground POST claims the run slot, inserts the run row, fires an HMAC-signed self-dispatch to a new `/_agent-native/agent-chat/_process-run` route, and returns the existing `subscribeToRun` SSE stream so the client streams the same events via the cross-isolate SQL-poll path with no client change. The background worker idempotently claims the run, runs the full multi-step loop to completion under a host-natural soft-timeout (`backgroundFunction` mode lifts the 40s clamp for that invocation only — the foreground/interactive clamp is unchanged), and chains a server-driven continuation if a chunk hits its budget unfinished. A background-aware stale window (`dispatch_mode`) prevents a cold-starting background run from being falsely reaped. With the flag off, the agent-chat run path is byte-for-byte the current synchronous behavior.

  As a per-host optimization layered on the portable baseline, the Netlify deploy build emits a second function whose name ends in `-background` (re-exporting the same `main.mjs` handler bundle, with a `config.path` of the process-run route) so the `_process-run` POST runs on Netlify's async 15-minute budget and a long turn completes in one invocation; on that invocation the worker's soft-timeout is raised to ~13 min (`backgroundFunction` mode) instead of 40s. This emit is build-time gated on the same `AGENT_CHAT_DURABLE_BACKGROUND` flag for both the single-template (`deploy/build.ts`) and workspace (`deploy/workspace-deploy.ts`) deploy paths: when the flag is unset at build time the emit functions are never invoked, so the deploy output (functions, routing, config) is byte-identical to today and the default single-function deploy is unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- 38266fc: Move "Collapse sidebar" to the top of the agent panel's options menu (the `⋯` dropdown in the sidebar header), above All chats / Agent runs / Settings, with a separator below it. Makes the most common dismiss action the first item in the list.
- 38266fc: Fix inline MCP App embeds being hard-killed on `resources/read`. The inline-embed kill switch was enforced inside the shared `resolveMcpAppResource` resolver, which also backs `resources/read` — so when a host read a `ui://` URI it already held (e.g. a cached descriptor) while embeds were disabled, it got a hard `-32603` instead of the shell. The switch is now enforced only at the advertisement/render sites (`tools/list` descriptor meta, `tools/call` result meta, `resources/list`), so disabled embeds are never advertised while `resources/read` still degrades gracefully to the served shell.

## 0.70.3

### Patch Changes

- 3c80603: Document and regression-test that `useActionQuery` / `callAction` GET calls round-trip boolean and number params. Browser query params are serialized through `URLSearchParams`, which stringifies everything — so `useActionQuery("instrument-overview", { includeSeries: true, limit: 5 })` sends `includeSeries: "true"` / `limit: "5"`. Schema-aware coercion (added in 0.70.2) already restores native types before validation, but it was framed and tested only as a model-gateway concern. This adds an end-to-end regression test through the action route for the GET path and broadens the coercion doc comment so it is not narrowed to gateway-only and silently re-break browser GET calls. No runtime behavior change.

## 0.70.2

### Patch Changes

- 2d36525: Add a sync helper for keeping Builder Agent-Native Starter's standalone manifest aligned with the chat template scaffold output.

## 0.70.1

### Patch Changes

- 8003c56: Coerce gateway-stringified tool arguments before action validation. Some model gateways (notably Builder's Gemini-backed gateway) hand structured tool-call arguments back as JSON strings — an array param arrives as `"[{...}]"`, a boolean as `"true"`. Standard Schema (zod) validation does not coerce, so these calls failed validation and the agent could thrash retrying different shapes (and hang). The validation wrapper now coerces a string value to the type its schema field declares (array/object via `JSON.parse`, boolean, number/integer) when — and only when — the schema expects a non-string type and the string parses cleanly to it; ambiguous or unparseable values are left untouched so the normal validation error still surfaces.
- 8003c56: Composer model picker improvements. The picker now supports an optional secondary "image model" menu via a new `imageModelMenu` prop on `AgentChatSurface` / `AssistantChat` (opt-in; chat-only apps are unaffected) — apps that drive a separate generation model (e.g. Assets' image model) can surface it in the same dropdown so it's clear which model reasons about the request and which produces the output. The reasoning-effort list is now a collapsed-by-default accordion (matching the provider groups) instead of always-expanded, keeping the menu compact. Model catalog: the Builder gateway list now lists Opus 4.8 (was 4.7) and drops the retired GPT-5.1 Codex Mini entry.
- 8003c56: Remove the setup/onboarding checklist that appeared above the agent chat (the
  "Setup N of 5" panel with Connect an AI engine / image & video generation /
  asset storage / email / GitHub steps) and its header "Setup" re-open button.
  Setup is now surfaced in better places — the settings panel and per-feature
  setup affordances — so the panel no longer takes up sidebar space in any app.
- 8003c56: Feedback submissions now forward a `clientSurface` hint (web / electron / tauri)
  alongside the existing page URL, so form owners can tell whether feedback came
  from the Agent-Native desktop app, a Tauri shell (e.g. Clips), or a browser.
  Detection is exposed as a reusable `getClientSurface()` client helper and is
  passed through as hidden metadata — it never appears as a visible form field.
- 8003c56: Fix the "Sign in with Google" button getting stuck disabled when the OAuth
  window is closed without finishing (e.g. to retry in a different browser
  profile). The button was only ever re-enabled on an explicit OAuth error or
  the 5-minute poll timeout, so a cancelled sign-in left the primary CTA greyed
  out with no way to retry short of refreshing. The sign-in screen now re-enables
  the button (and stops the pending exchange poll) when the window regains focus
  or becomes visible again — mirroring the existing email-verification recovery.
- 8003c56: Add observability and a safety valve for inline MCP App embeds, on top of the
  Codex/Cursor transplant fix already shipped in 0.70.0.

  When an inline embed cannot load in a host, the shell now reports a bounded,
  structured diagnostic (stage, message, HTTP status, host, render mode, bridge
  type) to a new CORS-open `POST /_agent-native/mcp/embed-error` route, which
  forwards it to Sentry via `captureError` — so embed failures across Codex,
  Cursor, ChatGPT, and Claude are inspectable instead of an opaque spinner. The
  failure card also surfaces the specific cause (e.g. "Embedded app returned HTTP
  500" / session-expired) and promotes "Open in new tab" to the primary action.

  Adds a deploy-toggleable kill switch for inline MCP App embeds, **off by
  default**. Set `AGENT_NATIVE_MCP_APPS_INLINE=1` to enable inline embeds for an
  environment; while it is off, accounts listed in
  `AGENT_NATIVE_MCP_APPS_INLINE_ALLOW_EMAILS` (comma/space separated) still get
  them, so a fix can be verified in production before it reaches normal users.
  When disabled, no `ui://` resource is advertised or referenced and tool results
  fall back to their deep-link text — no skills/instructions change required.

- 8003c56: Show a friendly "You're all set" confirmation page after authorizing an MCP
  client whose redirect is a native deep link (cursor://, vscode://, …). Instead
  of leaving the browser tab dangling on a blank page after the OS handed the code
  to the app, the tab now shows a checkmark, a "return to your agent to continue"
  message, and re-fires the deep link so the client still receives the code.
  https/loopback callbacks keep the standard redirect.
- 8003c56: Clarify the "Where should visual plans and recaps live?" install prompt: move
  the "(recommended)" marker into the hosted option's label and tighten its
  description to "100% free and open source. Supports comments, browser editor,
  and sharing. Requires one-time browser sign-in."
- 8003c56: When a hosted run is cut off mid-step and exhausts its in-invocation
  continuation budget without finishing, the chat now ends with a loud,
  unambiguous "stopped before finishing" terminal instead of a silent stall or a
  misleading clean `done`. The terminal carries a machine-readable
  `run_budget_exhausted` error code that is deliberately excluded from the
  client's auto-recoverable allow-list, so the chain terminates rather than
  looping another continuation into the same wall, and any half-streamed partial
  text is cleared so the message stands alone.

## 0.70.0

### Minor Changes

- b35c8cb: Add an in-app changelog ("What's new") surface. Every app can now ship a
  user-facing `CHANGELOG.md` that renders in the command menu (Cmd+K) and in
  settings. Core provides `<ChangelogDialog>`, `<ChangelogSettingsCard>`, a
  `changelog` prop on `CommandMenu` (with an unseen-release dot), and an
  `agent-native changelog add|release|list` CLI that authors changeset-style
  pending entry files and rolls them up into the dated `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Patch Changes

- b35c8cb: Fix MCP app embeds for OpenAI's default web-sandbox origin and keep an Open in new tab fallback available when inline app loading fails.
- b35c8cb: Return native redirect responses from web OAuth callbacks so successful sign-ins
  land on the clean return URL instead of retaining provider callback query
  parameters.
- b35c8cb: Add a public `GET /_agent-native/health` route that runs a trivial `SELECT 1`
  to report database liveness and, as a side effect, keep a scale-to-zero
  serverless database (e.g. Neon) warm. A scheduled ping against this endpoint
  prevents the multi-second cold-start that otherwise stalls the first request
  to an idle app. The probe always responds (apps with no database report
  `db: false` rather than failing) and is never cached. Disable it with the
  `disableHealth` core-routes option.
- b35c8cb: Fix MCP app embeds rendering only a flashing/permanent loading state in Codex
  and Cursor. These standards-track hosts render the `ui://` resource in a strict
  opaque-origin sandbox (`sandbox="allow-scripts"`) and talk to it over the
  postMessage `ui/*` bridge. The shell's handshake was already correct, but for
  these hosts it fell through to self-navigating the sandboxed iframe to the real
  app origin, which tears down the host bridge and loses the opaque-origin auth
  context. Any host connected through the native MCP Apps bridge (Codex, Cursor,
  the SDK App fallback, our own renderer) now transplants the app document into
  the shell — the same robust path Claude already uses — keeping the bridge alive
  and loading via embed-token auth. Also handle the spec `host-context-changed`
  notification and bump the cached resource shell version so hosts refetch.
- b35c8cb: Fix the missing inline screenshot on PR Visual Recap comments. The `recap shot`
  command runs `page.evaluate`/`addInitScript` payloads that contain named inner
  functions; when the CLI is run through `tsx`/esbuild (CI's trusted-workspace
  path), esbuild's `keepNames` wraps those functions in `__name(...)`, which
  Playwright then serializes into the browser where `__name` is undefined —
  throwing `ReferenceError: __name is not defined`, dropping the screenshot, and
  falling back to a link-only comment. `runShot` now injects an identity `__name`
  shim as the first browser init script, so every main-world payload is safe
  regardless of how the CLI was transpiled (the tsc-built published package, which
  never emits `__name`, is unaffected).
- b35c8cb: When a long agent run is cut off mid-stream while assembling one large tool input (a generation that exceeds the ~40s soft-timeout window), the auto-continue nudge now points the resumed model at the incremental-edit path for that specific action instead of only handling `create-extension`. Designs (`generate-design` → `edit-design`), plans (`create-visual-plan`/`create-ui-plan` → `update-visual-plan`/`patch-visual-plan-source`), and dashboards (`update-dashboard` incremental `ops`) get tailored "ship a compact first version, then refine" guidance, with a generic compact-first fallback for any other large-payload action. This breaks the re-stream-the-same-oversized-payload thrash loop that could otherwise burn the whole continuation budget without making progress.
- b35c8cb: Capture first-touch referral attribution and enrich the signup event (`referral_source`, `referrer_user`, UTM, `first_touch_path`) to measure app virality. The browser records an anonymous visitor's first-touch context (`ref`/`via`/`utm_*` params, landing path, and referring host) into an `an_attribution` localStorage key and a first-party `an_ft` cookie, and the server-side `signup` event is enriched from that cookie so every template can see where new users came from.

## 0.69.0

### Minor Changes

- 530de18: Add Firecrawl as a BYOK backend for the web-search agent tool. When `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` is configured (via app secrets or environment) the tool routes searches through Firecrawl's `/v2/search` API. It slots into the existing first-configured-wins chain after Brave, Tavily, and Exa, and before Builder-managed search, and is registered as an optional framework secret so it surfaces in every template's settings UI.

## 0.68.3

### Patch Changes

- 9db3c12: Fix Cloudflare Pages worker bundling for content-heavy templates and add the published Clips Chrome extension URL defaults.

## 0.68.2

### Patch Changes

- feaf633: Add a reusable CommandMenu docs group so apps can surface relevant Agent-Native documentation from Cmd+K.
- feaf633: Fix PR visual recap head fetching in private fork workflows without persisting checkout credentials.
- feaf633: Submit Builder branch waitlist requests to the configured Forms endpoint on hosted Agent-Native deployments.
- feaf633: Try legacy Google OAuth client credentials during refresh after rotating product OAuth clients.
- feaf633: Allow deployments to configure identity-only Google sign-in credentials separately from product Google OAuth credentials.

## 0.68.1

### Patch Changes

- 48356d7: Forward Builder gateway heartbeat JSONL frames through the engine and agent SSE stream so long upstream silences (adaptive thinking, TTFT) do not trip the client no-progress timeout.
- 48356d7: Fix guided question selection UX: preserve answers across poll refreshes, pause polling while a form is open, show clearer selected-state affordances (including `aria-pressed` on option buttons), and stop duplicate Explore/Decide injection in Design question flows.
- 48356d7: Resume page-load chat reconnect from the last seen run event seq instead of replaying the full SSE history, preventing duplicated assistant turns after refresh.

## 0.68.0

### Minor Changes

- a623ab6: Ship a generated source corpus with the core package and expose source-search so agents can inspect version-matched core and template patterns from installed apps.

### Patch Changes

- a623ab6: Add configurable agent tool controls for database and extension surfaces. `databaseTools` now accepts `"write"` (default), `"read"`, and `"off"` in addition to booleans, and `extensionTools: false` removes framework extension-management tools and prompt guidance.
- a623ab6: Surface extension runtime errors that occur before the iframe error toast mounts.
- a623ab6: Collapse question-form and visual-questions inputs after copying or sending answers to the agent, with an edit affordance to reopen them.
- a623ab6: Reduce Sentry noise from expected agent-chat quota/rate-limit failures, auth-card recovery, and oversized document attachment validation.
- a623ab6: Hide development-only skill files from runtime source-search results and direct corpus reads.
- a623ab6: Improve PR Visual Recap coverage for agent-native PRs: trusted fork authors run through the fork-safe workflow automatically, trusted public same-repo instruction edits no longer false-skip, PR heads are fetched before diffing, and unhealthy Plan routes stop before the agent runs.

## 0.67.1

### Patch Changes

- 7ceb907: Allow native/desktop IDE clients (Cursor, VS Code) to complete the remote MCP
  OAuth flow. The Dynamic Client Registration endpoint previously rejected any
  `redirect_uris` that were not `https://` or `http://localhost`, so IDEs that
  register a private-use URI scheme callback (e.g. `cursor://…`, `vscode://…`,
  permitted by RFC 8252 §7.1) failed at registration with
  `invalid_client_metadata` and never obtained a token. Registration now also
  accepts private-use schemes while still requiring PKCE and rejecting
  script/file-capable schemes (`javascript:`, `data:`, `file:`, `blob:`,
  `vbscript:`, `about:`), fragments, and embedded credentials.

## 0.67.0

### Minor Changes

- 1b61a90: Add tab-scoped application-state helpers so multi-tab agents read the screen of the tab they were sent from.
  - Server: `readAppStateForCurrentTab`, `writeAppStateForCurrentTab`, `appStateKeyForBrowserTab`, and `getCurrentRequestBrowserTabId` (from `@agent-native/core/application-state`). These resolve the requesting tab via `getRequestRunContext().browserTabId`, read the `key:<tabId>` value first, and fall back to the global key for CLI/external agents.
  - Client: `getBrowserTabId` (from `@agent-native/core/client`), a stable per-tab id backed by sessionStorage.

  The default app scaffold (`view-screen` action and `tab-id` helper) now uses these so newly generated apps are tab-correct by default.

  Without tab scoping, `navigation` (and similar ambient UI state) was a single global key shared across browser tabs, so a chat in one tab could act on whatever clip/record another tab navigated to last.

## 0.66.9

### Patch Changes

- 11a28e7: Track first-time Google OAuth signups and flush server-side signup tracking
  before auth returns so low-volume events are delivered reliably from serverless
  deployments.

## 0.66.8

### Patch Changes

- f514c12: Add the Content app-backed skill and a `skills add content --mode local-files`
  install path that writes Content local-file workspace defaults to
  `agent-native.json`.
- f514c12: Pass Codex CLI approval policy before the `exec` subcommand so local Code runs
  work with current Codex CLI argument parsing.
- f514c12: Allow `pnpm action <name> '{"arg":"value"}'` to pass a positional JSON object
  to defineAction and package actions while preserving existing flag arguments.
- f514c12: Show the onboarding setup prompt in the agent sidebar on normal deployed app surfaces so required Builder/BYOK setup is visible to users.
- f514c12: Prefer inline Builder connect guidance for chat attachment upload recovery.

## 0.66.7

### Patch Changes

- 3d7df7d: Normalize exhausted provider rate-limit errors in agent chat and keep raw 429
  provider messages in diagnostics instead of the primary UI copy.
- 3d7df7d: Dismiss code annotation hover cards on layout changes and outside interactions.

## 0.66.6

### Patch Changes

- 337bcc5: Fix visual plan layout polish: compact question previews, mark wide-eligible tabs for diff-like content, align drag handles with wide blocks, and theme custom HTML iframes for dark mode.
- 337bcc5: Move the sidebar Connect AI setup card above the composer and stack its actions.
- 337bcc5: Keep the wireframe style toggle outside the Rough.js measurement scope so sketch mode no longer draws a ghost outline for the hidden Clean button.

## 0.66.5

### Patch Changes

- c650d44: Fix `agent-native code` crashing with `Unknown engine: "codex-cli"` when the Codex CLI runner is selected via the `AGENT_ENGINE` environment variable. The Codex branch in `executeCodeAgentRun` now falls back to `AGENT_ENGINE` the same way `resolveExecutorEngine` already does, so `AGENT_ENGINE=codex-cli` routes to the Codex CLI runner instead of being handed to the LLM-provider engine resolver (which only knows the AI-SDK providers).

## 0.66.4

### Patch Changes

- 54b2c33: Fix Google sign-in on mobile web dropping the post-login return URL. The OAuth
  callback's mobile branch attempts the `agentnative://oauth-complete` deep link
  (for the native app) but previously hardcoded its fallback to the app root, so
  a signed-out visitor who opened e.g. a `/recaps/:id` link in a phone browser
  got bounced to the homepage after authenticating instead of back to the page
  they came from. The fallback now returns to the validated `returnUrl`; the
  native-app deep link is unchanged.

## 0.66.3

### Patch Changes

- 533afe1: Default organization activation now auto-creates unless explicitly disabled, and Builder setup copy stays focused on storage and AI credits.

## 0.66.2

### Patch Changes

- 89d3852: Clarify in the docs how instructions, skills, and actions work together as the
  core building blocks of Agent-Native agents.
- 89d3852: Use the Agent-Native blue accent for auth verification and success states.
- 89d3852: Show a friendly email validation message on the built-in auth page instead of exposing raw Better Auth schema errors.
- 89d3852: Ignore loopback app URL env values when resolving hosted auth email links.
- 89d3852: Shorten the default feedback popover placeholder.

## 0.66.1

### Patch Changes

- 113abe7: Clarify in the docs how instructions, skills, and actions work together as the
  core building blocks of Agent-Native agents.
- 113abe7: Shorten the default feedback popover placeholder.

## 0.66.0

### Minor Changes

- bd0d8b5: Add an ACP (Agent Client Protocol) harness adapter so Agent-Native can act as an
  ACP client and drive local coding agents — Gemini CLI, Claude Code, or any
  ACP-compliant agent — through the existing `AgentHarness` substrate.

  `createAcpHarnessAdapter({ command, args })` spawns the agent over stdio and
  maps ACP `session/update` notifications, permission requests, and `fs/*` calls
  onto harness events, approvals, and file-change events. Built-in presets
  `acp:gemini` and `acp:claude-code` are registered by
  `registerBuiltinAgentHarnesses()`, alongside a generic `acp` entry. The protocol
  transport (`@zed-industries/agent-client-protocol`) loads lazily as an optional
  dependency.

## 0.65.0

### Minor Changes

- 2b8cfd0: Add an `@agent-native/core/embedding` export surface (`./embedding`,
  `./embedding/react`, `./embedding/bridge`, `./embedding/agent`,
  `./embedding/protocol`) that hosts the `EmbeddedApp` component and embed bridge.

  The implementation moved here from the workspace-only `@agent-native/embedding`
  package, which is not published to npm. Standalone scaffolds of templates that
  embed apps (content, design, assets) previously rewrote their `workspace:*`
  dependency on `@agent-native/embedding` to `latest`, which 404'd on install
  because the package isn't published. Those templates now import the embed
  surface from the published `@agent-native/core` instead, so
  `create --standalone --template content` installs cleanly. The
  `@agent-native/embedding` package remains as a thin re-export for backward
  compatibility.

## 0.64.1

### Patch Changes

- 13c202b: Pin `@tiptap/*` dependencies to an exact, fully-published version (3.27.1) instead of caret ranges. Tiptap extension packages exact-pin their `@tiptap/core` and `@tiptap/pm` peer dependencies, so a caret range let npm climb to the newest tiptap release and fail with `ETARGET No matching version found for @tiptap/extension-table@<x>` during the brief window when a new tiptap version is only partially published. Pinning keeps installs of `@agent-native/core` (and `@agent-native/skills`, which depends on it) reproducible and unaffected by upstream staggered publishes.

## 0.64.0

### Minor Changes

- 9d5f12b: `create` now asks how you want to start (Full template / Chat / Headless) before
  the template picker. Chat and Headless scaffold a single standalone app; Full
  template continues into the workspace multi-select. Flag-driven paths
  (`--template`, `--headless`, `--standalone`) skip the prompt and are unchanged.

## 0.63.6

### Patch Changes

- 0105ab5: Fix a broken in-docs anchor in the "creating templates" guide: the headless on-ramp link now points to `/docs/getting-started#1-create-your-app` instead of the stale `#create-your-agent`, which no longer matches any heading on the Getting Started page.

## 0.63.5

### Patch Changes

- 7c28a87: Fix CLI commands hanging indefinitely on success due to Node.js keep-alive and telemetry timers

## 0.63.4

### Patch Changes

- 7d72d52: Restore subtle glowing hover indicators on annotated code ranges.
- 7d72d52: Use fast shadcn tooltips and clearer Tabler icons for diagram style toggles.
- 7d72d52: Preserve deep-link return targets through auth and federated SSO sign-in.

## 0.63.3

### Patch Changes

- ad14341: Diagram primitives got a polish pass: `.diagram-pill`/badge/chip elements now hug
  their label (`width: fit-content`) instead of stretching to fill a flex column,
  and `.diagram-node`/`box`/`card`/`panel` carry sensible base padding so text never
  touches the box edge when an author diagram omits its own padding.

## 0.63.2

### Patch Changes

- d9e93a3: Add an explicit `codexCliAuth` opt-in for `ai-sdk-harness:codex` so trusted sandboxes can reuse local Codex CLI login, and document how it differs from Agent-Native Code/Desktop auth.
- d9e93a3: Fix headless app onboarding so plain Node action discovery can load generated
  TypeScript actions, and avoid Tailwind peer warnings for headless installs.
- d9e93a3: Show the first code or diff annotation by default when Plan has room for margin notes, while keeping additional annotations available on hover. Add contextual controls for switching wireframe and diagram visuals between sketchy and clean styles.

## 0.63.1

### Patch Changes

- 7157583: Export the in-loop processor API (`TripWire`, `Processor`, `ProcessorState`, `ProcessorAbort`) from the package root so the `@agent-native/core` imports shown in the In-Loop Processors guide resolve.
- 7157583: Rename the onboarding path from headless action to headless agent in docs and CLI copy.
- 7157583: Make Codex CLI subscription auth easier to discover in Agent-Native Code docs and provider copy, and document that Codex harness auth is supplied by the AI SDK Codex runtime while Code/Desktop sessions reuse the locally signed-in Codex CLI.
- 7157583: Add shared full-page chat handoff helpers so apps can morph a chat tab into the
  agent sidebar while preserving the active thread.
- 7157583: Document Clips' agent-readable public clip context, transcript, and timestamped frame APIs.

## 0.63.0

### Minor Changes

- b7c8bb6: Make the package root (Node `default` entry) server-safe so headless apps work out of the box.

  The top-level `@agent-native/core` entry used by Node/SSR/headless contexts no
  longer re-exports the React client barrel. Re-exporting `./client/index.js` from
  the Node entry eagerly pulled `react`, `react-router`, and
  `@tanstack/react-query` into the module graph, so a freshly scaffolded
  `--headless` app (which installs none of those) crashed at module load on the
  documented first command, `pnpm action hello`. The React client surface still
  ships via the `browser` condition (so UI bundles that import client helpers from
  the bare specifier keep working) and via the explicit `@agent-native/core/client`
  subpath.

  Also fixes the headless scaffold's `tsconfig.json`, which inherited
  `types: ["vite/client"]` from the shared UI base config and failed `pnpm
typecheck` with TS2688 because a headless app has no Vite dependency. It now
  overrides `types` to the Node set it actually uses.

  Migration: code that runs through the Node entry (SSR, scripts, headless) and
  imports React client helpers (`useDbSync`, `cn`, `useSession`, `sendToAgentChat`,
  etc.) from `@agent-native/core` should import them from `@agent-native/core/client`
  instead. Browser-only code is unaffected.

## 0.62.1

### Patch Changes

- edb1fa7: Keep code-like blocks left-to-right inside RTL plans. Code, code-tabs, diff,
  file-tree, annotated-code, API endpoint, OpenAPI spec, JSON explorer,
  data-model, schema-editor, diagram, mermaid, and wireframe blocks now pin their
  outermost element to `dir="ltr"` (via a shared `ltrCodeBlockProps` helper) so
  they no longer inherit a Persian/Arabic plan document's RTL direction and render
  reversed. Prose, rich-text, and callout blocks intentionally stay RTL.

## 0.62.0

### Minor Changes

- 8a74b0a: Add `agent-native agent`, `agent-native agents list`, the `/_agent-native/agents` discovery route, and read-only share links for agent chat threads with bounded run summaries.
- 8a74b0a: Add a headless `agent-native create --headless` scaffold for primitive-first action apps, with `--template=headless` and legacy `--template=blank` routing to the same action-only starter.

### Patch Changes

- 8a74b0a: Add a small agent-native client helper for listing workspace agents and invoking sibling apps by id, name, or URL.
- 8a74b0a: Remove top-level JSON Schema combinators from Anthropic tool input schemas before sending requests so strict provider validation does not reject valid framework tools.

  Also mark the Assets template as requiring the embedding package so generated workspaces can resolve `@agent-native/embedding/bridge` during deploy builds.

- 8a74b0a: Add the Chat template as the public minimal app on-ramp and keep Starter as a legacy CLI alias.
- 8a74b0a: Allow Agent-Native Code to run through the local Codex CLI when Codex is signed in, and update provider copy to mention Codex CLI auth.
- 8a74b0a: Load integration prompt resources in compact mode so Slack, email, and webhook runs do not inline full skill or memory context.
- 8a74b0a: Add composable mini-apps guidance to workspace agent instructions and synced workspace-core skills so generated workspaces teach sibling discovery, A2A invocation, and provider-api composition patterns.

## 0.61.0

### Minor Changes

- 96a0668: Add source-aware Builder database foundation: derive the real Builder space name via the Admin GraphQL API and surface it (plus the connected spaces) through the Builder status route and `useBuilderStatus`, with non-blocking, cached lookups so the connect-flow polling never blocks on Builder.

  Builder deploy credentials remain blocked from impersonating signed-in users in hosted production. Local development can explicitly opt into env-key fallback for Builder dogfooding with `AGENT_NATIVE_LOCAL_BUILDER_ENV=1`; the escape hatch is non-production only.

## 0.60.0

### Minor Changes

- ca3efcf: Add `agent-native agent`, `agent-native agents list`, the `/_agent-native/agents` discovery route, and read-only share links for agent chat threads with bounded run summaries.
- ca3efcf: Add a headless `agent-native create --headless` scaffold for primitive-first action apps, with `--template=headless` and legacy `--template=blank` routing to the same action-only starter.

### Patch Changes

- ca3efcf: Add the Chat template as the public minimal app on-ramp and keep Starter as a legacy CLI alias.
- ca3efcf: Allow Agent-Native Code to run through the local Codex CLI when Codex is signed in, and update provider copy to mention Codex CLI auth.
- ca3efcf: Load integration prompt resources in compact mode so Slack, email, and webhook runs do not inline full skill or memory context.
- ca3efcf: Add composable mini-apps guidance to workspace agent instructions and synced workspace-core skills so generated workspaces teach sibling discovery, A2A invocation, and provider-api composition patterns.
- ca3efcf: Add Dispatch automation status controls backed by jobs markdown resources.
- ca3efcf: Fix active chat follow-up queueing so ordinary sends during a running turn stay queued, keep the thinking indicator attached to the active response, retry any fresh user turn — queued follow-ups and normal sends fired shortly after the previous run finished — through transient 409 active-run conflicts instead of reconnecting to the prior run (which replayed its answer, dropped the new message, and corrupted thread history), while still letting genuine internal continuations resume the active run, and stabilize built-in data widget renderers to avoid chart remount loops.
- ca3efcf: Add GitHub repository file helpers to the provider-api runtime, plus agent/headless tools and a reusable action factory for listing, searching, reading, writing, and deleting files through GitHub connector credentials or `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
- ca3efcf: Add a headless A2A invocation primitive for calling agent-native apps by id, name, or URL, wired through the `agent-native invoke` CLI command.

## 0.59.1

### Patch Changes

- e151605: Fix active chat follow-up queueing so ordinary sends during a running turn stay queued, keep the thinking indicator attached to the active response, retry any fresh user turn — queued follow-ups and normal sends fired shortly after the previous run finished — through transient 409 active-run conflicts instead of reconnecting to the prior run (which replayed its answer, dropped the new message, and corrupted thread history), while still letting genuine internal continuations resume the active run, and stabilize built-in data widget renderers to avoid chart remount loops.

- e151605: Pre-optimize core client dependencies during monorepo dev so chat-heavy apps avoid Vite optimized-dependency reloads during navigation.

## 0.59.0

### Minor Changes

- d3e0239: Reliably deliver the first agent-chat message on a cold start (buffer it until a
  chat thread exists instead of dropping it), and gate prompt boxes up front when
  no provider key, Builder connection, or BYOK key is configured. New exports:
  `useAgentEngineConfigured`, `BuilderSetupCard`, `parseSubmitChatMessage`.

## 0.58.5

### Patch Changes

- a832c55: Fix intermittent 404s on `/_agent-native/actions/*` (and other framework routes)
  on serverless deploys. Routes are registered inside an async plugin init that
  Nitro v3 does not await, and the production Nitro dispatcher snapshots its
  middleware list once at the start of h3's `handler()` — so the readiness-gate
  middleware, which runs inside that snapshot, could await init yet still fall
  through to a bare 404 (surfaced in the client as a `true` error toast) for a
  request that arrived on a cold isolate. The readiness wait now also runs as a
  Nitro `request` hook, which h3 awaits before route + middleware resolution, so
  late-registered routes exist by the time routing happens. The existing
  middleware gate is retained as a fallback.

## 0.58.4

### Patch Changes

- f16980e: Replace the agent chat loading text with a shimmering Agent-Native logo lockup
  with an animated ellipsis, and attach scoped chat context badges directly above
  the composer.
- f16980e: Close the current Agent Sidebar chat tab when clearing chat into a replacement.
- f16980e: Fix active chat follow-up queueing so ordinary sends during a running turn stay queued, keep the thinking indicator attached to the active response, and stabilize built-in data widget renderers to avoid chart remount loops.
- f16980e: Expose agent-chat plugin options for skipping first-turn workspace inventory and sending a compact starter tool catalog that expands from tool-search results.
- f16980e: Improve Plan block layout resilience for positioned diagrams and tabbed code surfaces.
- f16980e: Prevent org-visible resources from being saved without an organization, and let Plan visual recaps resolve the publisher's active org when an older token lacks org context.
- f16980e: Add Plan visual-answer publishing helpers and pass merged PR metadata through PR visual recap publishing.
- f16980e: Render native data widgets even when `render-data-widget` echoes truncated JSON.
- f16980e: Soften the shared chat composer surface color.

## 0.58.3

### Patch Changes

- bb38b6f: Harden core tool argument parsing, JSON Schema handling, and tool error surfacing.

## 0.58.2

### Patch Changes

- 2c3fcb9: Improve native chat widget guidance and attachment handling so agents render structured data natively and preserve SVG/reference uploads correctly.
- 2c3fcb9: Fix SVG chat attachment handling so vector uploads are treated as file references instead of malformed vision image parts.

## 0.58.1

### Patch Changes

- a2992cb: Implement `AUTH_DISABLED` so local dev, preview, and demo deployments can skip login/signup and run all requests as a shared `dev@local.test` user.

## 0.58.0

### Minor Changes

- 9e20092: Add public OpenAI Responses, OpenAI Agents SDK, AG-UI, Claude Agent SDK, and Vercel AI SDK connector helpers for `AgentChatRuntime`.

### Patch Changes

- 9e20092: Add a public "Harness Agents" docs page documenting the `AgentHarness` substrate (`@agent-native/core/agent/harness`): built-in Claude Code / Codex / Pi adapters, `registerBuiltinAgentHarnesses`/`resolveAgentHarness`/`startAgentHarnessRun`, resumable SQL-backed sessions, host tools and permission modes, event translation, background-run surface, and custom adapters.

## 0.57.0

### Minor Changes

- 3446e34: Implement AgentChatRuntime factories and AssistantChat runtime mounting for BYO agent chat transports.

### Patch Changes

- 3446e34: Hide Pi from the interactive skill instruction picker because the shared `.agents` target already covers Pi-compatible skills.
- 3446e34: Make `plan local check` catch every required `checklist`/`question-form` field
  the Plan renderer enforces, not just per-item `id`. Previously a local plan
  missing a checklist item `label`, or a question `title`/`mode`, or an option
  `label`, passed `plan local check` with a false green and then got stuck on
  "Loading plan" when the hosted renderer rejected it (`expected string`). The
  lint now validates `id` + `label` on checklist items and options, and `id` +
  `title` + a valid `mode` enum on questions, so authoring mistakes surface
  locally before the browser handoff. The visual-plan/visual-recap skills now
  spell out the full required-field set.
- 3446e34: Accept `agent-native plan serve` as a compatibility alias for `agent-native plan local serve`.
- 3446e34: Fix the plan plugin docs to teach the canonical `plan local serve` command for local-files preview (it previously taught `plan local preview`, which runs a different local dev-server route), and note the `plan serve` short alias.

## 0.56.1

### Patch Changes

- e3e8515: Preserve native chat widget registrations when packaged apps are bundled for deployment.

## 0.56.0

### Minor Changes

- 78687a1: Add an explicit native tool-render registry plus built-in chat data table and
  chart widgets, with same-app widget action links that navigate through the
  shared chat view-transition path. Add an app chat option for typed-action-only
  agent surfaces that disables raw database tools while preserving rich native
  widget rendering from action results. Add server-safe helpers for constructing
  typed data widget action outputs.

### Patch Changes

- 78687a1: Clarify the Getting Started docs: restore per-template doc links in the grouped
  template list, remove the duplicated `create` command block from the
  add-apps section, and move "Common next moves" to the end so the page closes on
  next steps instead of mid-page.
- 78687a1: Relax hero chat composer padding for a roomier full-page chat input.
- 78687a1: Add provider API corpus recipes and provider corpus job source summaries so agents can audit which raw provider record body a broad search actually covered.
- 78687a1: Simplify the missing AI connection prompt and render it below the chat composer.

## 0.55.0

### Minor Changes

- 364e4be: Add reusable chat-home and chat view-transition primitives for chat-first apps,
  including centered empty-state layout, sidebar storage-key sharing, and opt-in
  sidebar reopening while active chats continue across route handoffs.
- 364e4be: Add an explicit native tool-render registry plus built-in chat data table and
  chart widgets, with same-app widget action links that navigate through the
  shared chat view-transition path. Add an app chat option for typed-action-only
  agent surfaces that disables raw database tools while preserving rich native
  widget rendering from action results.

### Patch Changes

- 364e4be: Chat: stop re-probing the server for a thread that already returned 404. The
  mount-time restore effect now caches known-absent thread ids for the page
  session, so navigating between routes no longer re-spams
  `GET /_agent-native/agent-chat/threads/:id` with 404s for a freshly created,
  not-yet-sent chat. Behavior is unchanged otherwise — a missing thread still
  falls back to an empty chat.
- 364e4be: Harden local Plan cold starts by validating checklist/question-form IDs, writing local serve URLs to `.plan-url`, adding headless bridge verification, and documenting Chromium/Safari guidance.
- 364e4be: Polish the skills CLI auth transcript so embedded connect output renders as one Clack guide block and shows spinner feedback during slow auth startup.
- 364e4be: Include tripwire abort text in processor result hooks and harden local plan repo-path containment against symlinks.

## 0.54.1

### Patch Changes

- cc1e11c: Fix workspace dev gateway losing the app prefix on root-relative redirects (e.g. Google OAuth flows). Path-only redirect `Location` headers are now rewritten to include the `/{app.id}` mount prefix, matching the repo `dev-lazy` gateway.

## 0.54.0

### Minor Changes

- f81e032: Add optional `outputSchema` to `defineAction` — validate an action's RETURN
  value (warn/strict/fallback). Pass a Standard Schema-compatible `outputSchema`
  (Zod, Valibot, ArkType — same surface as the input `schema`) and the framework
  validates the result AFTER `run()` resolves, composing with the existing input
  validation (input validated before `run`, output validated after). The
  `outputErrorStrategy` (default `"warn"`) controls the mismatch behavior:
  `"strict"` throws a clear error so a buggy action surfaces loudly, `"warn"`
  `console.warn`s the issues and returns the ORIGINAL result unchanged
  (non-breaking), and `"fallback"` returns the provided `outputFallback`. When no
  `outputSchema` is supplied, behavior is byte-for-byte unchanged (no wrapping).
  Borrowed from Mastra/Flue structured-output and kept dependency-free on the
  action layer.
- f81e032: Add an in-loop processor seam (`processOutputStream` / `processOutputStep` +
  `abort()` / `TripWire`) for real-time guardrails. `runAgentLoop` now accepts an
  optional `processors: Processor[]`. Each processor exposes optional hooks —
  `processOutputStream` (per streamed chunk), `processOutputStep` (once per model
  response, around tool execution, with the requested tool calls), and
  `processOutputResult` (once at run end) — and a per-processor mutable `state`
  that persists across hooks and is isolated between processors. A processor can
  call `abort(reason, meta?)` (throws an exported `TripWire`) to halt the run
  gracefully; the loop catches it, emits a new `{ type: "tripwire"; reason;
processor? }` agent-chat event, surfaces the reason as a final message, and
  stops. This is the structural prerequisite for real-time guardrails and a
  proof-of-done / coverage gate. Borrowed from Mastra's output processors and
  kept loop-internal configuration (processors only observe/mutate-stream/abort;
  they do not define app behavior or replace actions). When no processors are
  passed the loop is byte-for-byte unchanged with zero overhead.
- f81e032: Add token-efficient web content fetching for agents. `web-request` and `provider-api-docs` can now return extracted markdown, plain text, metadata, links, or bounded search matches instead of raw HTML, and `run-code` exposes `webRead()` plus pass-through options on `webFetch()` for compact web/document reduction.

### Patch Changes

- f81e032: Docs: document the agent-runtime features added since the first docs sweep.
  New pages: Human-in-the-Loop Approvals (`needsApproval` gate + `approval_required`
  / `approvedToolCalls` flow), Observational Memory (background three-tier
  compaction with `AGENT_NATIVE_OM_*` config), In-Loop Processors (the
  `processOutput*` guardrail seam + `TripWire` / `tripwire` event), and Durable
  Resume (tool-call journal — prompt note + tool-layer hard-block against
  re-running completed side effects). Folded action `outputSchema` /
  `outputErrorStrategy` and the `needsApproval` gate into the Actions page, and
  added an optional OpenTelemetry-spans section to Observability. All wired into
  the docs sidebar nav; no runtime behavior changes.
- 9909dcc: Avoid bundling native canvas from web content extraction in template SSR builds.
- f81e032: Allow the hosted Plan local-files UI to read the localhost bridge in Chromium by
  answering Private Network Access preflights.
- f81e032: Include repo-relative paths in direct local Plan preview URLs so local Plan app
  routes can reopen and edit MDX folders from the current repository.
- f81e032: Improve provider corpus jobs with a read-only status/results action helper and better multi-term snippet windows for durable provider searches.
- f81e032: Add app/template and agent-native-specific app/template properties to Better Auth signup tracking events.
- f81e032: Add VS Code extension open URLs to MCP open-link metadata.

## 0.53.0

### Minor Changes

- 5a57b60: Add a first-class evals primitive and an `agent-native eval` CLI runner that
  doubles as a CI deploy gate. Define test cases with `defineEval({ name, input,
scorers, threshold })` and compose scorers with the Mastra-style 4-step
  pipeline `createScorer({ preprocess, analyze, generateScore, generateReason })`.
  Built-in scorers ship for the common cases — `exactMatch`, `contains`,
  `usesTool`, and a provider-agnostic `llmJudge` (the judge model is resolved
  from the engine registry, never hardcoded). The runner discovers `**/*.eval.ts`
  and `evals/*.ts`, actually runs the agent loop for each input, scores the
  output, prints a readable scored table (or `--json` for CI), and exits
  non-zero when any eval scores below its threshold. Results are written to the
  observability eval store, with a documented seam for future live sampled
  scoring of production traffic through the same scorers.
- 5a57b60: Add opt-in per-action human-in-the-loop approvals. Actions can now declare
  `needsApproval` (a boolean or an `(args, ctx) => boolean | Promise<boolean>`
  predicate) on `defineAction`. When the gate resolves truthy, the agent loop does
  NOT execute `run()`: it emits an `approval_required` event carrying the tool
  name, a compact view of the input, and a stable `approvalKey`, then pauses the
  turn. A human approves by re-issuing the turn with that key in
  `AgentChatRequest.approvedToolCalls`, which lets the specific call run. The gate
  is default-off and fail-closed (a throwing predicate requires approval). The
  mail template's `send-email` action opts in as the canonical example.
- 5a57b60: Add the core of Observational Memory (OM): background compaction of a long
  agent thread into a dated, three-tier context (recent raw messages → dense
  "observations" → higher-level "reflections") so long-running threads cost far
  fewer tokens and stay prompt-cache stable.

  This ships the store (a new ownable Postgres `observational_memory`
  table + additive migrations), the Observer and Reflector compaction passes
  (provider-agnostic internal agent calls — no hardcoded model), the
  `maybeCompactThread` compactor entry point, and the `buildObservationalContext`
  read API returning the three tiers ready for prompt injection, all exported
  from `@agent-native/core/agent/observational-memory`.

  The read API and compactor are intentionally not yet wired into the agent loop:
  injecting `buildObservationalContext` output into `production-agent.ts` (and
  registering the migration plugin in the default plugin set) is a follow-up so it
  does not collide with concurrent agent-loop changes. The store creates its table
  lazily on first use, so OM is fully functional in the meantime.

- 5a57b60: Wire Observational Memory into the agent loop (compaction + long-thread context
  injection). The OM migration plugin is now registered alongside the other
  framework migration plugins so its table is created on startup. After a clean
  turn the loop runs a best-effort, fire-and-forget compaction pass
  (`maybeCompactThread`) so long threads accrue dated observations and
  reflections. On subsequent turns, threads that have already crossed the
  compaction threshold get their reflections+observations folded in as a leading
  context block while the recent raw-message window is preserved verbatim - short
  threads with no OM entries are left byte-for-byte unchanged.
- 5a57b60: Add `agent-native add <kind> [name|url]`, a blueprint installer. Instead of
  scaffolding files, it prints a curated Markdown integration blueprint to stdout
  so you can pipe it into your own coding agent (`agent-native add provider stripe
| claude`). A URL instead of a name emits a generic research-and-integrate
  blueprint with the URL as the research seed. Ships seeded blueprints for
  provider-api integrations, inbound channel adapters, custom sandbox adapters,
  and multi-surface actions; `--list` browses what's available.

### Patch Changes

- 5a57b60: Fix hosted skills install flows for Codex plus Claude Cowork client selections and make MCP connect polling handle structured device-code failures consistently.
- 5a57b60: Add an optional OpenTelemetry export to the agent loop. `instrumentAgentLoop`
  now wraps the run, each tool call, and the model call in OTel spans
  (`agent.run`, `tool.call`, `llm.call`) carrying tool name, model, token usage,
  and error attributes. The export is fully no-op unless a host installs
  `@opentelemetry/api` (a new optional dependency) and registers a tracer
  provider, so there is zero overhead by default and no heavy SDK is added to
  core.
- 5a57b60: Add a hard delegation-depth guardrail so sub-agents cannot infinitely spawn
  sub-agents. Each sub-agent now carries its delegation depth (top-level chat is
  0); `spawnTask` refuses server-side once a spawn would exceed the cap, returning
  a clear "Delegation depth limit reached" error to the parent agent. Enforcement
  lives in `agent-teams.ts` and reads the spawning agent's depth from the ambient
  run context, so it holds even if the team tool is not stripped. The cap defaults
  to 2 and is configurable via the `AGENT_NATIVE_MAX_SUBAGENT_DEPTH` env var
  (parsed and clamped, falling back to the default on invalid values).
- 5a57b60: Document four newly-landed framework features in the published docs content:
  pluggable sandbox adapters for the `run-code` tool (`SandboxAdapter`,
  `AGENT_NATIVE_SANDBOX`, `registerSandboxAdapter`), the first-class evals CI gate
  (`defineEval`, `createScorer`, built-in scorers, and the `agent-native eval`
  command), the sub-agent delegation depth guard
  (`AGENT_NATIVE_MAX_SUBAGENT_DEPTH`), and the `agent-native add` blueprint
  installer. Adds `sandbox-adapters`, `evals`, and `blueprint-installer` pages, a
  delegation-depth section in the Agent Teams doc, and surgical pointers in the
  harness-agents, observability, and external-agents skills.
- 5a57b60: Add an opt-out for agent-chat MCP mounting so apps can provide a dedicated stable MCP route.
- 5a57b60: Surface the current sub-agent delegation depth in the runtime-context prompt.
  The chat plugin now reads the ambient delegation depth and passes it into
  `buildRuntimeContextPrompt`, so a sub-agent already at the delegation cap is
  told it cannot spawn further sub-agents. The cap was already enforced
  server-side; this only makes it visible to the model.
- 5a57b60: Tool-call journal hard-block: skip re-executing journaled-complete tool calls on
  resume. The per-turn tool-call journal (derived from the durable run-event
  ledger) previously only added a prompt-level "already completed, don't re-run"
  note. The agent loop now enforces this at the tool layer: when a non-read-only
  tool call's exact (tool name + input) already completed in an earlier
  interrupted chunk of the same turn, `runToolCall` returns the recorded result
  instead of re-executing the side effect, while still emitting the normal
  tool_start/tool_done so the transcript stays coherent. Fresh calls with no prior
  completed journal entry are unaffected.
- 5a57b60: Add a per-turn tool-call journal that hardens the run-resume path against
  duplicate side effects. When a run resumes after an interruption (gateway or
  transport drop, cold start, or soft-timeout auto-continue), the journal is
  derived from the existing run-event ledger and injected into the resume nudge:
  tool calls that already completed are listed with their results and flagged as
  "do NOT re-run", and any tool call that started but never recorded a result is
  surfaced as "interrupted / unknown outcome" so the model can decide rather than
  blindly re-executing (e.g. re-sending an email or re-creating a ticket). The
  journal is read-only over the ledger (no new recording hook), best-effort, and a
  no-op for turns with no completed or interrupted tool calls, so normal resumes
  are unchanged.

## 0.52.0

### Minor Changes

- 9dc6ba7: Add a pluggable sandbox-adapter seam for the `run-code` tool. The
  code-execution sandbox now runs behind a `SandboxAdapter` interface so the
  execution backend can be swapped without changing agent code, the localhost
  bridge, the env scrub, or output formatting. The default
  `LocalChildProcessAdapter` preserves the existing spawned child-process behavior
  byte-for-byte. A different backend (e.g. a Docker or remote/durable runner) can
  be plugged in via `registerSandboxAdapter()` or the `AGENT_NATIVE_SANDBOX` env
  var — the documented lever for exceeding the hosted execution ceiling on long
  jobs.

### Patch Changes

- 9dc6ba7: Polish the shared skills CLI prompts, standalone catalog, and install summary.
  Add MCP install support for more local agent clients and keep the PR Visual
  Recap GitHub Action prompt available in local-files mode.
- 9dc6ba7: Store pasted agent chat provider API keys in scoped encrypted app secrets instead of deployment env vars.

## 0.51.15

### Patch Changes

- ef16690: Open local Plan previews from local-files mode and clarify plugin installs use hosted Plans by default.

## 0.51.14

### Patch Changes

- cb49d6f: Keep Plan install mode flags scoped to Plan skills when the public skills CLI delegates extra text-skill copies.

## 0.51.13

### Patch Changes

- 49685d9: Fix the shared skills CLI picker so the standalone skills package installs with
  its matching core runtime, defaults public skills visibly, asks the Plan storage
  mode before client setup, and avoids duplicate Claude Code client choices.
  The hosted Plans option now also calls out that it is 100% free and open
  source.

## 0.51.12

### Patch Changes

- 7a6b32b: Fix the shared skills CLI picker so the standalone skills package installs with
  its matching core runtime, defaults public skills visibly, asks the Plan storage
  mode before client setup, and avoids duplicate Claude Code client choices.

## 0.51.11

### Patch Changes

- 914c8db: Unify the skills CLI flow so `@agent-native/skills` delegates normal user-facing
  list/add flows to the core skills CLI with an expanded public skills catalog,
  while `agent-native skills` keeps the Agent-Native-only catalog.

## 0.51.10

### Patch Changes

- 14ea897: Harden local Plan block authoring guidance and align the standalone skills CLI with hosted, local-files, and self-hosted Plan modes.

## 0.51.9

### Patch Changes

- 077d67f: Add a no-auth `agent-native plan blocks` command and teach local Plans skills to
  use it before authoring local MDX.

## 0.51.8

### Patch Changes

- 0aa83d7: Only report assistant UI recovery errors to Sentry after the retry budget is exceeded.
- 0aa83d7: Clarify Plans skill setup with hosted, local-files, and self-hosted install modes.

## 0.51.7

### Patch Changes

- 499f728: Add durable provider corpus jobs for resumable paginated and batched provider searches.
- 499f728: PR Visual Recap workflow reliability + clarity:
  - Narrow the self-modifying-code skip guard so it only false-skips legitimate
    recaps: it still fires for fork PRs and for all public-repo PRs (where an
    author could rewrite loaded `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`/`.claude`/`.mcp.json` to
    exfiltrate the secret-backed agent run), but is skipped for private-repo
    same-repo PRs whose authors are trusted org members.
  - Surface the skip reason via `core.notice` so it appears as a run-summary
    annotation, not just a buried log line.
  - Retry the agent once when it exits without writing `recap-source.json` (a
    transient miss that previously failed the whole recap with an ENOENT).
  - Upload the agent transcript (`claude-result.json`/`codex-events.jsonl` + stderr)
    alongside `recap-source.json` on failure, so a recap that fails because the
    agent produced no/invalid output is debuggable instead of a black box.

## 0.51.6

### Patch Changes

- ba3b10b: Add the `providerSearchAll` run-code helper and refresh Content template marketing around open-source Obsidian for MDX positioning.
- ba3b10b: Block background agent-team delegation for provider/source sweeps after a read-only source/search tool has exhausted its convergence budget.

- 404f9d2: Block background agent-team delegation for provider/source sweeps after a read-only source/search tool has exhausted its convergence budget.

## 0.51.4

### Patch Changes

- 8b559ca: Tell agents not to bypass exhausted source-sweep budgets by delegating the same one-at-a-time provider fan-out to background agents or follow-up threads.

## 0.51.3

### Patch Changes

- 789b9ca: Clarify visual-plan ownership guidance so agents keep using structured Plans while choosing hosted, local-files, or self-hosted mode based on privacy and brand-control needs.
- 789b9ca: Tell agents to switch to bulk/code/provider API workflows when repeated source sweeps hit the convergence budget, instead of asking users to approve the obvious next read-only step.

## 0.51.2

### Patch Changes

- 3f2e709: Count source/search tool sweeps across internal agent continuations so hosted runs converge instead of resetting the sweep budget after serverless soft timeouts.

## 0.51.1

### Patch Changes

- 1c752f4: Stop repeated read-only source sweeps from looping indefinitely by forcing a final coverage summary after the same provider/search tool is called many times in one turn.

## 0.51.0

### Minor Changes

- 6896529: Add an AgentHarness substrate for running full agent runtimes through Agent
  Native, including durable harness session storage, AI SDK harness adapter
  support, run-manager integration, and background-run projection.
- 6896529: Add a shared provider API quota governor with request dedupe, Retry-After handling, and cooldown persistence.

### Patch Changes

- 6896529: Remove decorative box shadows from visual plan and recap wireframe frames.
- 6896529: Make the PR Visual Recap workflow easier to debug and safer against deploy
  gaps: upload the agent-authored `recap-source.json` as a CI artifact when the
  publish fails (previously only the screenshot was kept, so failures were
  opaque), and add a pre-publish route-health probe that fails with a clear
  "plan app routes return 404 - deploy not yet propagated" diagnostic instead of
  letting the agent run and fail confusingly when the plan server is behind.
- 6896529: Back workspace file helpers with the existing Resources table and keep the
  legacy workspace-files bridge hidden from normal agent tool lists.

## 0.49.27

### Patch Changes

- 1d466d6: Builder file upload provider now routes files over 30 MB through a signed-URL flow (request URL → direct storage PUT → register asset), so large uploads no longer hit the ~32 MB request cap. Smaller files keep the existing direct-POST path with retries.

## 0.49.26

### Patch Changes

- e63c360: Add durable hosted MCP ask_app tasks with ask_app_status polling.
- 8726f38: Teach all app agents that provider shortcut actions are not capability limits and that broad provider searches, joins, classifications, and absence claims should use provider API staging, saved responses, staged-dataset queries, or sandboxed code with explicit coverage reporting. Ensure lean, A2A, and MCP ask-agent registries include run-code when code execution is enabled, and give sandboxed code generic providerRequest/providerFetchAll helpers for broad paginated provider corpus work.
- e63c360: Support provider API pagination cursors sent through JSON request bodies.
- e63c360: Make PR visual recap robust to plan-app deploy-propagation windows. The recap
  CLI ships to npm independently of the plan-app server, so a recap can run after
  the new CLI is live but before the matching action routes have propagated to
  every cold-start server instance:
  - `create-visual-recap` publish now retries a transient 404 (the route 404s on a
    not-yet-updated instance) instead of failing the recap outright.
  - The live block-reference fetch (`get-plan-blocks`) now retries transient
    404s/timeouts before falling back to bundled instructions, so the agent
    authors against the current block vocabulary instead of stale tags.

- e63c360: Anchor overlapping code annotation hover cards to the right edge.

## 0.49.23

### Patch Changes

- dc1e7a0: Serve compact MCP tool catalogs by default and require explicit full-catalog opt-in.
- dc1e7a0: Improve agent-native analytics substrate: general provider staging detects single
  array payloads, code execution can call agent-exposed read-only actions, and
  providerFetch preserves structured request options.
- dc1e7a0: Harden PR visual recap screenshots by installing browsers from the recap CLI's Playwright package, retrying oversized screenshots at CSS scale, surfacing screenshot/upload diagnostics, and restoring fork workflow MCP smoke-test parity.
- dc1e7a0: Make MCP reconnect more resilient when OAuth metadata discovery is temporarily
  unavailable by retrying discovery and falling back to bearer-token reconnect for
  existing connectors.
- dc1e7a0: Soften recap code annotation cards and limit screenshot capture mode to one expanded annotation per block.
- dc1e7a0: Make PR visual recaps publish from an agent-authored source file through the
  deterministic CLI, avoiding flaky MCP tool discovery inside CI agent runtimes.

- 909a419: Polish PR visual recap comments, diagram framing, and screenshot annotation placement.
- 909a419: Run the PR visual recap on fork pull requests when the publish token is
  available. The gate now keys off secret availability instead of blanket-skipping
  all forks, so private orgs that send secrets to fork PRs get recaps on forks; the
  prompt gets the fork prompt-injection note via the new `--fork-pr` wiring, and
  forks without secret access get an actionable skip message.
- 909a419: Bound each PR visual recap MCP smoke probe with a per-attempt abort timeout so a
  cold-start hang on the plan app fails fast and the workflow's retry loop can
  re-probe a warm endpoint instead of blocking on undici's multi-minute default.
- 909a419: Allow PR visual recaps to run on visual-plan and visual-recap skill file changes
  when CI uses the default bundled recap instructions.

## 0.49.0

### Minor Changes

- d77a37f: Long-lived MCP OAuth tokens and lightweight reconnect command.
  - Access tokens are now long-lived (30-day default, env-overridable) with a
    sliding 365-day refresh window, so random 401s after one hour are eliminated.
  - Audience and signing-secret verification tolerances have been tightened to
    prevent spurious auth failures on host-drift or MCP URL variations.
  - `reconnect` command now detects any agent-native MCP config entry whose URL
    ends in `/_agent-native/mcp` for the given host, matching by URL regardless
    of connector name — no more breakage when the entry is named `plan` vs
    `agent-native-plans`.
  - Installs no longer write duplicate alias entries and clean up existing
    duplicates on the next connect or skills-add run.
  - All CLI, server, skill, and docs guidance now uses `npx @agent-native/core@latest reconnect <app-url>`
    as the documented one-line reauth path and consistently teaches that
    reinstalling from scratch is never needed to fix auth.

- d77a37f: Add best-effort install-funnel analytics to both skills CLIs (`npx @agent-native/skills@latest` and `npx @agent-native/core@latest skills`). Each run reports a step-by-step funnel — started, skills prompted, skills selected, clients selected, scope selected, install completed, MCP registered, connect, and completed/failed/cancelled — to the first-party Agent-Native Analytics endpoint, so install volume, skill selection, and step-by-step dropoff can be measured. Events carry a stable per-machine install id (unique installs) and a per-run id (dropoff) and never include paths, repo names, or other identifying data. Telemetry is fire-and-forget, flushes before exit, and is opt-out via `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` or `AGENT_NATIVE_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1`.
- d77a37f: Unify the two skills installers onto one codebase + UX.
  - `npx @agent-native/skills@latest add` / `list` now delegate to `@agent-native/core`'s
    clack-based installer (`runSkills`, newly exported at `@agent-native/core/cli/skills`),
    so the standalone CLI and `agent-native skills` share the exact same interactive
    experience, MCP-server registration, and authentication. A `AGENT_NATIVE_SKILLS_DIRECT`
    env guard keeps core's plain-repo delegation from looping back.
  - `agent-native skills add`: the optional PR Visual Recap GitHub Action is now offered
    **before** any install/registration, with copy that explains it's a GitHub Action and
    what it does. The final summary is rendered with clack (a boxed note + a "✅ All set!"
    outro that points you at the new slash command and a reload).

### Patch Changes

- d77a37f: Surface sanitized agent output when PR visual recap generation does not produce a plan URL.
- d77a37f: Clean up PR visual recap screenshots and comments by removing the GitHub `As of` line, capturing recap screenshots at 950px/100% zoom, and hiding viewer chrome plus changed-file sections in screenshot mode.

## 0.48.4

### Patch Changes

- 7ee8be6: Always hard-CDN-cache SSR for every visitor; make the login page an
  env-independent cacheable shell.

  The SSR handler was downgrading every authenticated request (any request
  carrying a session cookie) to `private, no-store`, so logged-in visitors got
  zero CDN caching on every page — including fully public pages like the docs
  site. SSR responses are now served with the standard public
  short-fresh / long-stale-while-revalidate policy for ALL visitors,
  authenticated or not. To make that safe, the SSR handler no longer reads the
  request session/cookies: it renders an impersonal public shell, and all
  per-user state (who is signed in, private records, share-grant access) is
  resolved client-side after load. A strong guardrail comment now documents that
  SSR must never vary by cookie/session and must never be marked private/no-store.

  Relatedly, the login page (the public homepage of every app) is now
  env-independent: a Google-only app always renders a working Google sign-in
  button instead of baking a render-time "Google sign-in is not configured"
  message into the CDN-cached HTML. A genuinely misconfigured server surfaces the
  error at click time via the auth API instead.

- 7ee8be6: Add a reusable `RequireSession` client gate that redirects unauthenticated
  visitors to the framework sign-in page instead of leaving a protected app shell
  stuck on an infinite loading spinner. The server-side auth guard only protects
  requests that reach the Nitro function; a statically-served/cached SPA shell or
  a client-side navigation after the session expired never re-hits it, so the app
  boots with no session and every data query 401s into a permanent loading state.
  Wrap a private app shell with `<RequireSession>` (with optional `bypass` for
  embed/popout surfaces that authenticate by another mechanism) to close that gap.
- 7ee8be6: Service token mint auto-resolves org from membership when bearer token has no org context
- 7ee8be6: Keep the agent sidebar's running indicator showing a steady "Thinking" while the
  model works, instead of flipping through transient framework step labels (e.g.
  "Contacting model", "Preparing X action") right after a message is submitted.
  The Reconnecting and Resuming connection states are unchanged.
- 7ee8be6: Skills installer: offer the two plan skills independently, prompt for scope, and
  install built-in instructions in-process.

  The interactive `agent-native skills` installer now offers exactly `visual-plan`
  and `visual-recap` as two separate, independently selectable entries (both
  checked by default) instead of a single bundled "Agent-Native Plan" row.
  Selecting both still registers the shared hosted plan MCP connector once;
  selecting only one installs just that skill. `agent-native skills add
visual-plan` / `visual-recap` likewise install only the named skill, while the
  bundle aliases (`visual-plans`, `plannotate`, …) still install both. The PR
  Visual Recap GitHub Action offer is now gated on `visual-recap` being part of
  the install.

  The installer also prompts for install scope (Project vs User) when `--scope`
  is not passed, matching the open `skills` CLI UX.

  Built-in skill instructions are now written straight into each client's skills
  directory instead of shelling out to `npx @agent-native/skills@latest` — that
  package is not published yet, so the previous delegation failed with a 404
  mid-install. External/plain skill repos still use the standalone installer.

- 7ee8be6: Recover from stale lazy-chunk failures on the current route. After a deploy,
  an old tab whose hashed chunk filenames no longer exist would strand the user
  on a broken view (and report `Failed to fetch dynamically imported module` to
  Sentry) whenever the failure was not tied to a fresh cross-route navigation.
  The route chunk recovery now performs a single, loop-guarded reload of the
  current page (via sessionStorage cooldown) for both unhandled dynamic-import
  rejections and `React.lazy` failures caught by the framework `ErrorBoundary`,
  fetching fresh assets instead of failing. Desktop webviews are left untouched,
  matching existing behavior.

  Wrap a private app shell with `<RequireSession>` (with optional `bypass` for
  embed/popout surfaces that authenticate by another mechanism) to close that gap.

## 0.48.1

### Patch Changes

- 60355cc: Fix recharts/es-toolkit default export error in dev

## 0.48.0

### Minor Changes

- 3c1d3eb: Resurrect end-to-end action type inference.

  `defineAction` overloads now return a typed `ActionDefinition<TInput, TReturn>` instead of `any`. The schema-inferred input type (via `StandardSchemaV1.InferOutput<TSchema>`) and the run callback's return type flow through to `useActionQuery`, `useActionMutation`, and `callAction` once the generated `.generated/action-types.d.ts` is included in the project's TypeScript config.
  - Added `ActionDefinition<TInput, TReturn>` interface (exported from `@agent-native/core`).
  - All 15 template `tsconfig.json` files now include `.generated/**/*` so the generated registry d.ts is picked up automatically.
  - Scaffold default tsconfig updated to match.
  - Exports `ActionDefinition` from the core package index.

- 3c1d3eb: Add a server-only `completeText()` helper for narrow one-shot text transforms through the framework engine layer, export custom chat adapter/surface types, and document background agent sends plus custom chat UI escape hatches.
- 3c1d3eb: Agent Teams completion loop, stop affordances, and orphan sweep
  - **Completion loop (P0)**: `finalizeAgentTeamRun` now appends a durable `parent-completion` injection to the parent thread's app-state queue and writes a NotificationsBell entry. The orchestrator chat's `prepareRequest` drains these injections and prepends them to the next user message so sub-agent results surface automatically without manual polling.
  - **Sub-agent tab read-only (P1)**: Sub-agent tabs in `MultiTabAssistantChat` now disable the composer (`composerDisabled`) with a descriptive placeholder. Sending from a sub-agent tab would start a new run on that thread and kill the in-flight team chunk; the disabled composer prevents this without touching `AssistantChat.tsx`.
  - **Stop affordances (P1)**: Added `POST /runs/:id/stop` route in agent-chat-plugin that delegates to `stopAgentTeamBackgroundRun`. `RunsTray` now shows a stop button (Tabler `IconPlayerStop`) for running agent-team rows. `AgentTaskCard` shows a Stop button in its footer while the task is running. Both use optimistic UI.
  - **Orphan sweep (P2)**: A server-side sweep runs every 2 minutes (via a 30s check interval + 2-min throttle) to reconcile all owners with active queue rows. Re-fires stuck/queued dispatches when the browser is closed and no RunsTray poll triggers.

- 3c1d3eb: Add edit, regenerate, and branch picker affordances to the chat UI.
  - **Edit user messages**: hover the pencil icon on any user message (when not running) to enter inline edit mode; the bubble swaps to a textarea composer with Cancel/Save buttons. Sending an edited message creates a new branch via assistant-ui's edit composer semantics. Edit is disabled while a run is active to avoid race conditions with the abort+wait path.
  - **Regenerate last assistant message**: a refresh icon appears on the last assistant message's action bar on hover, using `ActionBarPrimitive.Reload`. Disabled automatically while the thread is running. Regenerate creates a client-side branch from the parent user message and sends the prior history to the server as a fresh run; the server appends the new response as a new `thread_data` entry (consistent with the append-only fold — no duplicate or conflict).
  - **Branch picker**: when a message has multiple branches (after edits or regenerations), `BranchPickerPrimitive` shows ‹ 1/2 › navigation on that message, styled to match the existing ghost action-bar buttons. Shown on both user and assistant messages.

- 3c1d3eb: Code tab improvements: always-allow and deny buttons in the approval callout (model auto-resumes after both); persist command allowlist per-machine so approved commands skip future approvals; emit thinking-delta events from the agent loop as collapsible transcript cells; surface cumulative input/output token counts and approximate context-window usage per run; Electron notifications for run-completed, run-failed, and approval-needed when the window is unfocused (with dock badge on macOS); byte-offset transcript tailing in the main process so only appended JSONL bytes are read on each file-watch event instead of re-reading the whole file.
- 3c1d3eb: Add structured tool cells for the Code tab: bash terminal view with exit code / duration badges, edit diff viewer (computed client-side from old/new text), write cell with new-file styling, and an end-of-turn files-changed summary. Raise the bash output retention window to first 4 KB + last 16 KB. Emit structured metadata (command, cwd, exitCode, durationMs, oldText/newText, lineCount) from the coding-tools executor as a side-channel so the UI can render bespoke cells without breaking the string-result contract the agent sees.
- 3c1d3eb: Add connector-catalog tier for hosted multi-tenant MCP deployments.

  When `AGENT_NATIVE_CONNECTOR_CATALOG=1` is set and a template declares a `connectorCatalog` in `createAgentChatPlugin` options, external MCP clients see only the declared action allow-list plus the four builtin cross-app tools (`list_apps`, `open_app`, `ask_app`, `create_embed_session`). Calls to tools outside the list are rejected. Individual callers can opt up to the full surface by minting their token with `agent-native connect --full-catalog`, which embeds a `catalog_scope: "full"` claim in the JWT. Local and dev deployments without the env flag are unaffected. The plan template declares its curated connector catalog covering plan CRUD, sharing, upload, navigation, automations, and tool-search while excluding db-exec, seed-\*, extension tools, browser-session tools, and context-xray internals.

- 3c1d3eb: Add per-model context window table and one-shot overflow recovery
  - `model-config.ts`: new `getContextWindowForModel(modelId)` helper and explicit
    context-window table covering all catalog models. Claude Sonnet 4.6 / Opus 4.7+
    = 1 M, Haiku 4.5 / Fable 5 = 200 K, GPT-5.4/5.5 = 1.05 M, Gemini 2.x/3.x
    = 1 M, unknown models = conservative 128 K default.
  - `client/context-xray/format.ts`: new `resolveContextWindow(modelId?)` helper
    that replaces the hard-coded 200 K constant in `ContextMeter` and
    `ContextXRayPanel` so the gauge and headroom calculation reflect the real
    window for large-context models.
  - `agent/production-agent.ts`: context-window overflow is no longer a terminal
    dead-end. On the first overflow the agent attempts one automatic recovery pass:
    old tool-result content (outside the most-recent 10-message tail) is replaced
    with a short stub and the engine call is retried once. Only if that second
    attempt also overflows does the terminal error fire — with updated copy that
    explains the recovery attempt and suggests continuing in a new chat or asking
    the agent to summarize. New exported pure helper `trimOldToolResults` is
    unit-tested independently.
  - `client/error-format.ts`: `context_length_exceeded` / `input_too_long` errors
    now append a "Start new chat" CTA link (matching the `builder_gateway_error`
    pattern) so users have a one-click escape path from the error card.

- 3c1d3eb: Extract hand-copied template shell into `@agent-native/core` as shared exports.

  New exports:
  - `@agent-native/core/server/entry-server` — exports `handleDocumentRequest` (default) and `streamTimeout`. Superset of all 6 entry.server.tsx variants in the template fleet. Removes dead `typeof wrapWithAnalytics === "function"` guards (it is a plain import, never conditionally undefined). Adds `.well-known/` 404 rejection (content template improvement, now the default for all).
  - `@agent-native/core/client` — exports `AppProviders`, a composed `QueryClientProvider → ThemeProvider → TooltipProvider → Toaster` shell. Accepts `queryClient` prop so each template keeps its own `createAgentNativeQueryClient(overrides)` call. Supports the public-path SSR branch pattern (calendar/clips/content) via `isPublicPath` + `clientOnlyFallback` props.

  `templates/starter` and `packages/core/src/templates/default` (scaffold) are migrated to one-line re-exports of the shared handler. A sync spec (`starter-shell-sync.spec.ts`) guards byte-identity between scaffold and starter so they never drift again.

- 3c1d3eb: Lazy-load the assistant-ui chat stack (~650-700 KB gzip) off the critical path of every page.
  - `AgentPanel`: `MultiTabAssistantChat` converted to `React.lazy` + `Suspense`; sidebar chrome renders immediately while the chat chunk loads.
  - `AssistantChat`: `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm` deferred via a module-level async loader (same pattern as shiki); plain-text fallback shown during the one-frame load window.
  - New `@agent-native/core/client/api-path` source alias registered in `CORE_CLIENT_SUBPATHS` and `getCoreSourceAliases` so monorepo dev resolves it from `src/`.
  - All `templates/*/app/entry.client.tsx` (and the scaffold copy) changed to `import { appBasePath } from '@agent-native/core/client/api-path'` so the full client barrel — and its transitive chat-stack imports — are no longer in the static closure of the client entry point.
  - `@agent-native/core/client/api-path` is an existing public export; `AssistantChat`, `MultiTabAssistantChat`, `ResourcesPanel`, `SettingsPanel`, and `AgentTerminal` remain re-exported from the barrel for consumers that use them directly (marked minor because the barrel lazy-routing is a behaviour change for those named re-exports).

- 3c1d3eb: Add server-side staging layer for provider-api responses.
  - **Staging primitive (P0)**: `provider-api-request` now accepts `stageAs` to write response items into a scoped scratch dataset (`staged_datasets` + `staged_dataset_rows`) instead of returning the raw body. Returns `{ dataset, rowCount, columns, sampleRows }` — keeping large payloads out of the context window and avoiding the 50 K-char truncation that silently biases aggregates.
  - **Paginated fetch-all (P1)**: Pass `pagination` alongside `stageAs` to fetch all pages server-side (cursor / page / offset modes). Handles 429 / Retry-After with exponential back-off. Caps at `maxPages` (default 50, up to 200) and returns `{ pages, rows, truncated, lastCursor }`.
  - **New actions**: `query-staged-dataset` (in-process TypeScript aggregation — groupBy, sum/avg/count/min/max, where filters, orderBy/limit), `list-staged-datasets`, `delete-staged-dataset`. Postgres-compatible without dialect-specific JSON SQL.
  - **Storage caps**: 200 K rows / 50 MB per app. Dataset ownership is scoped to `(app_id, owner_email)`.
  - **Analytics template**: adds the three staging actions and updates `cross-source-analysis` + `provider-api` skills to teach the stage-then-aggregate flow.

- 3c1d3eb: Expose focused public client subpaths for custom chat, composer, conversation, collaboration, rich-editor, and resources UI composition.

  Adds `@agent-native/core/client/chat`, `@agent-native/core/client/composer`, `@agent-native/core/client/conversation`, `@agent-native/core/client/collab`, `@agent-native/core/client/editor`, and `@agent-native/core/client/resources`, promotes the low-level `TiptapComposer` props/types through the composer surface, exports `dedupeCollabUsersByEmail`, and documents how to rebuild agent chat/sidebar, realtime presence, rich editor, and resources experiences from public pieces.

- 3c1d3eb: Export `createAgentNativeQueryClient` from `@agent-native/core/client` with house defaults (staleTime 30s, auth-aware retry, refetchOnWindowFocus false); raise commandRefetchInterval default from 2s to 15s.
- 3c1d3eb: Upload-first chat attachments: when a file-upload provider is configured, images and files are uploaded to hosted URLs at send time and stored as URL references in thread_data (no more base64 blobs in SQL). Added `read-attachment` core tool for paginating large text attachments that exceed the 60 K context limit. Base64 fallback path retained with a 2 MB-per-attachment cap.

### Patch Changes

- 3c1d3eb: Add the `@agent-native/skills` installer CLI for plain Codex/Claude skill repos and let `agent-native skills add` delegate public skill repositories like `BuilderIO/skills` to it.
- 3c1d3eb: Harden agent runtime resume and chat attachment edge cases.
- 3c1d3eb: Add Content-Security-Policy to app document responses: `object-src 'none'; base-uri 'self'` enforced, `script-src` emitted as Report-Only with a Sentry-config hash when configured. Skipped in dev and opt-outable via `AGENT_NATIVE_DISABLE_DOC_CSP=1`.
- 3c1d3eb: AppProviders parity polish: add `disableThemeTransitions` prop (default `true`),
  wire it through ThemeProvider `disableTransitionOnChange`; restore pre-migration
  per-template parity — calendar `position="bottom-center"`, dispatch `closeButton`,
  content animated transitions + deduped toaster, slides `defaultTheme="dark"` (drops
  outer ThemeProvider workaround), brain `tooltipDelayDuration={250}`, macros
  `defaultTheme="dark"` + `tooltipDelayDuration={300}`; migrate plan root to
  AppProviders; reconcile scaffold/starter `entry.client.tsx` and enable byte-identity
  guard.
- 3c1d3eb: Extend `AppProviders` with customisation props needed for dark-first and theme-customised templates.

  New props on `AppProvidersProps`:
  - `defaultTheme` — passed to next-themes `ThemeProvider`. Defaults to `"system"`. Dark-first templates (videos, slides, macros, analytics) pass `"dark"`.
  - `themeAttribute` — passed to next-themes `ThemeProvider.attribute`. Defaults to `"class"`. Use `["class", "data-theme"]` when CSS variables are keyed off a data-theme attribute.
  - `tooltipDelayDuration` — passed to Radix `TooltipProvider.delayDuration` (ms).
  - `toaster` — custom Toaster element. Pass `null` to suppress the built-in Toaster when children include a styled one.

- 3c1d3eb: Decompose AssistantChat.tsx into cohesive chat/ sub-modules (behavior-identical extraction). AssistantChat.tsx reduced from ~6,600 to ~3,200 lines with all public exports preserved via re-exports.
- 3c1d3eb: Fix agent chat intermittently scrolling to the top when sending a prompt in an ongoing conversation. When the message list briefly shrank on a re-render (content swap, collapsing streaming/reconnect placeholder, message list remount), the browser-forced `scrollTop` clamp was misread as the user scrolling up, detaching auto-follow and stranding the conversation scrolled up — sometimes at the very top. The near-bottom autoscroll handler now ignores downward scroll jumps caused by content shrinking, so it stays anchored to the bottom; genuine user scroll-ups still detach.
- 3c1d3eb: Reject SVG and non-raster MIME types on avatar write to prevent stored-XSS via data:image/svg+xml payloads.
- 3c1d3eb: Consolidate 7 private copies of normalizeAppBasePath/getAppBasePath onto the canonical exported module in `server/app-base-path.ts`. Adds `getAppBasePathFromViteEnv` for SSR builds that need `import.meta.env` fallback, and `stripAppBasePath` as a shared helper. Template-literal copies inside the generated Cloudflare worker entry in `deploy/build.ts` are intentionally left in place as they cannot import at runtime.
- 3c1d3eb: Fix db.transaction(async …) throwing on the default local database by replacing the sync-only native wrapper with a manual transaction path; nested async calls use SAVEPOINTs.
- 3c1d3eb: Prune orphaned \*.spec.js / \*.spec.d.ts files from dist in finalize-build.mjs; add incremental tsc across all tsc-built packages to speed up repeated builds.
- 3c1d3eb: Raise coding agent maxIterations from 12 to the shared DEFAULT_AGENT_MAX_ITERATIONS (100) and inject AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md + .agents/skills index into the system prompt so the coding agent respects repo instructions and knows what skills are available.
- 3c1d3eb: code-agent-executor: structured multi-turn history and bash improvements

  Replace the flat transcript-blob approach in `buildCodeAgentMessages` with proper `EngineMessage[]` reconstruction. The most-recent 40 transcript events are rebuilt as native user/assistant/tool-call/tool-result message pairs; older events are folded into a compact summarised preamble. This gives the model the same structured conversation replay that the sidebar uses, preserving tool-call ↔ tool-result pairing across follow-up turns and resumes.

  Also raises the bash default timeout from 30 s to 120 s, and adds a `background: true` parameter to the bash tool that spawns the command detached, returning the PID and a log-file path immediately.

- 3c1d3eb: Add --full-catalog flag to agent-native connect, matching the documented behavior.
- 3c1d3eb: Add a framework-level `core-send-email` agent tool (registered in every template when RESEND_API_KEY or SENDGRID_API_KEY is set) that sends markdown-body emails via the core transport. The tool description enforces a draft-first safety rule so the agent always shows the email to the user before sending. Keyed `core-send-email` to avoid colliding with the mail template's richer `send-email` action.
- 3c1d3eb: Dependency health fixes on the auth/runtime critical path:
  - Bump `better-auth` from exact `1.6.0` to `1.6.16` (16 patches behind)
  - Add root pnpm override pinning `kysely` to `^0.28.9` to prevent `0.29.x` pulling in breaking `DEFAULT_MIGRATION_TABLE` removal that breaks Vite builds while tsc stays green
  - Add `"sideEffects": ["*.css"]` to enable tree-shaking; client barrel is excluded (has module-level `installRouteChunkRecovery` and `stripAuthRedirectParamFromUrl` side effects)
  - Remove `@tabler/icons-react` from `dependencies` — already declared as optional peer; every template depends on it directly
  - Align `recharts` from exact pin `3.8.1` to range `^3.8.1` matching templates
  - Bump `nitro` nightly from `3.0.260415-beta` to `3.0.260603-beta`
  - Bump `vite` catalog pin from `8.0.3` to `8.0.16`

- 3c1d3eb: Comprehensive docs refresh: fix documented-but-nonexistent APIs (AUTH_DISABLED, notify/list-notifications, delegate-to-agent tool, scheduler endpoint), correct flagship examples to kebab-case actions and real Drizzle calls, consolidate the workspace docs cluster, split MCP Apps authoring into its own page, refresh template docs against current schemas, and standardize the template page skeleton.
- 3c1d3eb: Wrap Drizzle's Neon pool with the same withDbTimeout + retryOnConnectionError resilience as the raw DbExec path, preventing frozen-WebSocket 500s on template actions.
- 3c1d3eb: Fix agent-teams reliability: untruncated sub-agent results (50k char cap), proper engine resolution via resolveEngine in \_process-run, progress-aware continuation budget with no-progress detection, sub-agent token accounting with labeled usage recording, and double-claim fencing via attempts counter on heartbeat/bump/finalize writes.
- 3c1d3eb: Harden attachment handling across the chat surface:
  - **HEIC/TIFF/AVIF images**: always transcode non-web-safe image formats (HEIC, TIFF, AVIF, BMP, etc.) to JPEG/PNG via canvas before attaching; throw a visible composer error if transcoding fails instead of silently attaching raw bytes. Server-side, inject a text placeholder for any unsupported image that bypasses the client so the model knows the image was present.
  - **Base64 images in prompt text**: stop inlining image data-URLs into the text prompt string (≈700K tokens per MB); CLI code-agent now passes images as proper engine `image` content parts. PromptComposer no longer inlines images into prompt text.
  - **PDF and body-size caps**: cap PDFs at 4 MB with a clear composer error; estimate the total serialized attachment body and aggressively re-compress images if over 3.5 MB, rejecting the largest attachment with a clear error if still over.
  - **Server-side upload limits**: `/file-upload` and `/resources/upload` now enforce a 25 MB file size cap (413) and reject executable/script MIME types (415). New `readBodyWithSizeLimit`, `isAllowedUploadMimeType`, and related constants exported from `@agent-native/core/server`.
  - **Silent failure UX**: drag-drop and paste attachment errors are now surfaced as a dismissible inline error banner above the composer instead of silently logging to the console.

- 3c1d3eb: Fix four chat streaming UX issues: (1) P0 race where plain Enter while a run was active caused the new message to never be sent (appended to assistant-ui while the server run was still alive, resulting in a 409 → reconnect to old run under the new prompt); now aborts the active run first and waits for it to clear before appending. (2) P2 tool results for parallel same-name tool calls could get swapped; now matches by server-assigned id when present, with name-matching fallback. (3) P2 resuming affordance: show "Resuming…" in the thinking indicator during the 250 ms continuation window between serverless chunks, and show the last live activity label instead of bare "Thinking". (4) P1 backgrounded-tab catch-up lag: when the tab returns from background with a large streaming backlog (> 2000 graphemes), jump the reveal cursor to near the tail so only the last ~200 graphemes animate in rather than replaying minutes of content.
- 3c1d3eb: Engine and model-catalog robustness fixes: Gemini 3.x now uses `thinkingLevel` instead of the rejected `thinkingBudget`; structured provider errors (statusCode, providerRetryable) flow through EngineError so retry logic avoids false-negative and false-positive matches; isRetryableError covers OpenAI "Rate limit reached", Google RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED/quota, and bare 429/500/502/503/529 status codes; isContextTooLongError covers Gemini "input token count exceeds" phrasing; model catalog adds claude-fable-5, claude-opus-4-8, removes decommissioned Groq (llama-3.1-70b-versatile, mixtral-8x7b-32768) and stale cohere alias; supportsClaudeXHigh is version-aware for future opus successors; builder-engine enables prompt caching with system+tools+final-message cache_control breakpoints; OpenRouter default output tokens raised from 1024 to 8192; global token clamp raised from 32768 to 64000; usage pricing table adds fable-5, opus-4-8, Gemini 3, Groq, Mistral entries.
- 3c1d3eb: Fix four run-loop reliability bugs: widen RUN_STALE_MS to 15s to reduce false-positive stale reaps; self-abort displaced zombie runs and guard final status writes with a conditional WHERE so they cannot clobber a newer run's state; add per-run event persistence chaining so out-of-order SQL commits no longer silently gap the reconnect cursor; atomically gate double-run prevention with a SQL claim check instead of a racy read-then-act; emit 'clear' before resumable-error continuations to prevent duplicated partial text.
- 3c1d3eb: Add `forkPr` flag to `buildRecapPrompt` that injects a prompt-hardening security note when the diff originates from a fork PR, marking diff content as untrusted user-supplied data rather than instructions.
- 3c1d3eb: Add missing indexes on the hottest per-second poll queries: application_state (updated_at) and (key, updated_at), settings (updated_at), and org_members LOWER(email)
- 3c1d3eb: Skip direct-endpoint Neon connections on steady-state boots with no pending migrations, and close migration execs when done
- 3c1d3eb: Add org-scoped service tokens so CI credentials (e.g. the `PLAN_RECAP_TOKEN` secret used by PR Visual Recap) belong to the organization instead of one person. Previously the token was a personal device-flow bearer keyed to one owner's email — if that person left or revoked their tokens, every repo's recap CI started 401ing, and CI-created plans were owned by an individual.
  - `mcp_connect_tokens` gains additive `kind` / `service_name` / `created_by` columns; service tokens authenticate as a synthetic service principal (`svc-<name>@service.<orgId>`) whose resolved session carries the org id, so rows created by CI are org-scoped and visible to org members.
  - New core actions: `create-org-service-token` (org owner/admin, token value returned once and never stored), `list-org-service-tokens` (any org member, metadata only), and `revoke-org-service-token` (org owner/admin, same revocation gate as personal tokens).
  - New CLI flow: `agent-native connect <url> --service-token <name> [--ttl-days <1-365>]` authenticates the human via the existing device flow, mints the org service token, and prints it once with guidance to store it as the `PLAN_RECAP_TOKEN` secret.
  - Personal connect-token behavior is unchanged.

- 3c1d3eb: Enable noUnusedLocals and noUnusedParameters in core tsconfig; fix all violations.
- 3c1d3eb: Plan/recap renderer audit fixes: per-block salvage with error boundary (one bad block shows an "Unsupported block" card instead of blanking the document); annotated-code collapse for long unannotated runs; auto-TOC synthesis from block semantics when heading-derived items are sparse; file-tree rows carry data-file-path for recap files-rail scroll; export exceedsPlanBlockDepth from shared plan-content for server-side depth-exceeded detection in salvage path.
- 3c1d3eb: Visual-plan / visual-recap skill content audit fixes: visual-plan gains the same never-inline publish rule as visual-recap (stop and give the reconnect step instead of falling back to inline chat content); Core Workflow now leads with `get-plan-blocks` and the mode-matched create tool; the dead `PLAN_SETUP_AUTH_MD` constant is interpolated instead of hand-inlined; the canvas coordinate rule is stated once (surface locks footprint, board-level artboard x/y allowed for lanes); diagram-authoring guidance is deduped to a single owner in document-quality; recap gets a canonical section skeleton with numeric budgets (3-8 key-change tabs, ~150 lines per tab) and a GOOD/BAD exemplar; stale references fixed (`diffstat` block, "Wireframe Quality core below/above" pointers, implementation-maps frontmatter); the pre-share Plan-viewer render check is scoped to hosts with a browser tool; before/after columns guidance is scoped to document-body wireframes with a canvas alternative. All SKILL.md and references/\*.md copies regenerated byte-identical.
- 3c1d3eb: Gate localhost CORS fallback on NODE_ENV=development so production deployments without CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS no longer trust arbitrary localhost origins with credentials.
- 3c1d3eb: Modularise the system-prompt stack: extract FRAMEWORK_CORE and FRAMEWORK_CORE_COMPACT into typed builder functions under `packages/core/src/server/prompts/`, share rules 8–10 and the new rules 14–15 between both variants via a single source of truth, make provider/action examples injectable via `AgentChatPluginOptions.promptExamples`, add per-model-family overlays (GPT/Gemini), gate the 2 KB first-session personalization block to new threads only, add a "Response length" guidance section to both variants, and strengthen the `manage-progress` tool description with Codex-style plan discipline.
- 3c1d3eb: Prevent annotated code and diff hover cards from flashing during scroll dismissal.
- 3c1d3eb: Audit fixes for the PR visual-recap pipeline: emit diff byte/line size and a full-read instruction in the agent prompt so agents read the whole diff before authoring; add package-lock.json, bun.lockb, .next/, _.min.js, _.min.css, and \*.map to diff excludes; reorder diff file segments source-first before truncation so dotfile dirs (.changeset/, .github/) are sacrificed instead of src/; add a small-diff override sentence in the prompt to override the skill's skip-small-diffs advice; tighten find-plan-id extraction to require ^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,64}$ so injected bot-comment markers are rejected; port the auth probe step and gate skip-comment refresh (issues: write) to the reusable workflow for parity with the copy variant; fix docs to use the correct check title "Visual recap in progress", align the headline to reflect bundled-by-default skill sourcing, and complete the subcommand list.
- 3c1d3eb: Add minimal DI seams to recap.ts I/O functions for test coverage: `fetchFn?` on `githubRequest`/`findExistingComment`/`upsertComment`, `fetchFn?`/`waitFn?` on `uploadRecapImage`, and `importPlaywright?` on `runShot`. Export the four previously-private functions so the new `recap.io.spec.ts` can exercise them. No behavior change — all seams default to the original implementation.
- 3c1d3eb: Recap workflow polish: installer overwrite protection (`--force`), `RECAP_CLI_VERSION` variable pinning, auth-failure differentiation in sticky comment, screenshot size retry at scale-1 before skip, secret-scan allowlist (`.github/recap-scan-allowlist`), "pull request" copy fix, and gate-skip signal appended to existing sticky comment.
- 3c1d3eb: Add PR back-link to visual recap: `buildRecapPrompt` now deterministically threads `sourceUrl` (derived from repo + PR number) into the `create-visual-recap` tool call so the hosted recap page can link back to its source PR.
- 3c1d3eb: Add versioned reusable workflow for PR Visual Recap so consumer repos can delegate to `BuilderIO/agent-native/.github/workflows/pr-visual-recap-reusable.yml` instead of carrying a full copy. The `agent-native recap setup --reusable` flag writes a thin ~20-line caller; `buildReusableCallerWorkflow` and `writePrVisualRecapReusableCallerWorkflow` are exported for programmatic use.
- 3c1d3eb: Self-host Inter via @fontsource-variable/inter in the scaffold default template, eliminating the render-blocking Google Fonts @import from new apps
- 3c1d3eb: Replace shiki's Oniguruma WASM engine with the JavaScript regex engine in all client-side highlighters, removing ~608 KB from every template's asset bundle.
- 3c1d3eb: Collapse duplicate SSE+poll loops: extract shared SyncTransport so each tab opens one connection regardless of how many hooks subscribe.
- 3c1d3eb: SSR responses for authenticated requests are no longer publicly CDN-cacheable.
- 3c1d3eb: Eliminate duplicate org_members round trip on authenticated SSR requests: per-event memoize getOrgContext and reuse session.orgId when already backfilled.
- 3c1d3eb: Pin the Vite/Nitro dev-server runtime pair to the verified-compatible versions.
- 3c1d3eb: Cut O(n²) streaming render cost to O(tail) per commit with three targeted fixes: (1) block-memoized markdown — split streaming text into stable completed blocks + a live tail; completed blocks are wrapped in React.memo and skipped by React on every commit, only the tail re-renders; on completion a single-pass ReactMarkdown render guarantees identical final output. (2) Incremental grapheme segmentation — the Intl.Segmenter singleton is already cached at module level; now only the appended suffix is segmented per target change with a 16-char overlap to handle ZWJ/emoji cluster boundaries; falls back to full re-segmentation on non-append resets. (3) Debounced Shiki highlighting — while a code block is growing the Shiki codeToHtml call is debounced to 150 ms trailing, keeping the previous highlight visible between fires; a content-hash gate prevents redundant re-highlights on identical re-renders; a final immediate highlight fires when streaming ends. The shared HighlightedCodeBlock component is extracted to packages/core/src/client/HighlightedCodeBlock.tsx and used by both AssistantChat and AgentConversation.
- 3c1d3eb: Enable TypeScript strict mode across the framework monorepo. All template packages and core now compile with `"strict": true`, fixing implicit-any parameters, strict null checks, and function type contravariance throughout.
- 3c1d3eb: Harden agent tool dispatch with abort propagation, zombie-completion ledger, and scheduler resilience rail:
  - **Abort signal into tools**: `ActionRunContext` gains an optional `signal?: AbortSignal` field (backward-compatible). The run's abort signal is now threaded through to every `actionEntry.run()` call so well-behaved actions can cancel in-flight work instead of waiting for the 60-second hard timeout.
  - **Tool-call result ledger**: A new `agent_tool_ledger` table persists zombie completions (write-tool promises that resolve after `Promise.race` abandoned them on soft-timeout/abort). On continuation, when a write tool with the same `(threadId, toolName+inputHash)` key has a ledger entry, the continuation returns the ledger result without re-executing the side effect and without counting it toward the `MAX_WRITE_TOOL_INTERRUPTIONS` give-up budget. Ledger entries are cleared when a turn completes normally.
  - **Scheduler through the resilience rail**: Recurring jobs now route through `startRun` from run-manager instead of a bare `runAgentLoop` call. This adds a heartbeat row in `agent_runs` so a serverless kill is detected by `reapAllStaleRuns` on the next startup — no more permanently stranded `lastStatus:"running"` in job frontmatter. The soft-timeout wrapper is also applied so hosted jobs checkpoint cleanly before the function hard-kill boundary.

- 3c1d3eb: Remove dead `vite.config.server.ts` entry from tsconfig.base.json include array (the file does not exist).
- 3c1d3eb: Add a byte-identity guard spec for shared ui primitives across templates, and resync all drifted primitives to their canonical versions.

  The guard (`packages/core/src/templates/ui-primitives-sync.spec.ts`) hashes every `templates/*/app/components/ui/*.tsx` file and fails if any primitive diverges from the majority-held canonical without an explicit allow-list entry. The allow-list documents intentional deviations (custom-themed macros components, calendar DayPicker API version split, assets autoGrow textarea, etc.) so future drift is caught immediately.

  Resynced primitives include: tooltip (Portal + z-[250] + text-sm canonical), dropdown-menu (IconCircleFilled + container prop), popover (PopoverAnchor + portalled prop), dialog (hideClose prop), sheet (showClose/showOverlay props), sidebar (SheetTitle/SheetDescription accessibility), command (DialogTitle accessibility), badge, separator, scroll-area, label, form, alert-dialog, aspect-ratio, carousel, collapsible, drawer, input-otp, resizable, toggle (svg helpers + min-w), hover-card (origin transform var), navigation-menu (open state classes), radio-group and context-menu (IconCircleFilled), plus "use client" removal from forms/mail artifacts.

## 0.47.1

### Patch Changes

- 0ec6ded: Add "Interpreting comment anchors" section to the visual-plan skill and a
  matching pointer in visual-recap, teaching agents how to read coordinate
  frames, wireframe node ids, text-quote disambiguation, detached threads,
  routing via resolutionTarget, and two-axis consumed/resolved state.

## 0.47.0

### Minor Changes

- 600f83d: **Production code execution modes** (`codeExecution` plugin option + `AGENT_PROD_CODE_EXECUTION` env var)

  The agent chat plugin now accepts a `codeExecution` option to enable code-execution tools in production:
  - `"off"` (default) — no change to existing behaviour.
  - `"sandboxed"` — registers the new `run-code` tool in the production agent's tool registry.
  - `"trusted"` — registers both `run-code` and the full coding tool registry (`bash`, `read`, `edit`, `write`) in production.

  The `AGENT_PROD_CODE_EXECUTION` environment variable (`"trusted"`, `"sandboxed"`, or `"off"`) takes precedence over the plugin option, allowing per-deployment overrides without code changes.

  Dev-mode behaviour is unchanged.

  ***

  **Sandboxed `run-code` tool** (new `packages/core/src/coding-tools/run-code.ts`)

  A new `run-code` action lets the agent execute JavaScript (Node.js, ESM, top-level await) in an isolated child process:
  - Scrubbed environment: only `PATH`, `HOME`, `TMPDIR`, and similar safe POSIX vars are passed to the child. No app env vars or secrets.
  - Fresh temporary working directory per invocation.
  - Configurable timeout (default 120 s, max 600 s) and output cap (default 50 000 chars, max 200 000).
  - Ephemeral bridge HTTP server on `127.0.0.1` with a per-invocation random bearer token so the child can call allowlisted registered tools (`provider-api-request`, `provider-api-docs`, `provider-api-catalog`, `web-request`) with the parent's request context — without leaking secrets.
  - Child globals: `providerFetch(provider, path, init?)` and `webFetch(url, init?)`.
  - `run-code` is registered in dev mode unconditionally and in production when the mode is `"sandboxed"` or `"trusted"`.

  ***

  **Per-action tool limits** (`ActionEntry.timeoutMs`, `ActionEntry.maxResultChars`)

  `ActionEntry` now accepts optional `timeoutMs` and `maxResultChars` fields. When present, `runAgentLoop` uses these values instead of the global 60 s / 50 000-char defaults for that action.

  App-level defaults can be set via `toolLimits: { timeoutMs?, maxResultChars? }` on `createProductionAgentHandler` or `createAgentChatPlugin`. Per-action values take precedence.

  ***

  **`web-request` optional `maxChars` input**

  The `web-request` (fetch) tool now accepts an optional `maxChars` parameter (default 32 000, max 200 000) so the agent can request larger response bodies when needed without hitting the hard-coded 32 k truncation.

- 600f83d: **Custom provider registry** — register any API provider at runtime

  A new `custom_api_providers` SQL table (created on first use, additive) stores
  user/org-scoped provider registrations so the agent can call APIs that are not
  in the 24 built-in PROVIDER_CONFIGS:
  - `upsertCustomProvider`, `deleteCustomProvider`, `listCustomProviders`,
    `getCustomProvider` — CRUD helpers exported from `@agent-native/core/provider-api`.
  - `validateCustomBaseUrl` — SSRF-safe URL validation for registration time.
  - `createProviderApiRuntime` now accepts `getCustomProviders?: () => Promise<CustomProviderConfig[]>`.
    Custom providers are merged into the catalog after built-ins; they cannot
    shadow built-in ids.
  - Auth kinds supported for custom providers: `none`, `bearer`, `basic`,
    `api-key-header`. `google-service-account` and `oauth-bearer` are not
    supported (require out-of-band setup).
  - Credentials live in the existing secrets/credentials store — the provider
    row stores only credential key NAMES, never values.
  - SSRF guard (`isBlockedExtensionUrlWithDns`) is enforced at registration time
    and again at every request.

  **New Dispatch action: `provider-api-register`**

  Register, update, delete, or list custom providers:

  ```
  { operation: "upsert"|"delete"|"list"|"get",
    id, label, baseUrl, auth, docsUrls?,
    allowedHostSuffixes?, defaultHeaders?, notes?, scope? }
  ```

  **Updated Dispatch actions**

  `provider-api-catalog`, `provider-api-docs`, and `provider-api-request` now
  accept any provider id (built-in or custom) — the `provider` field is relaxed
  from `z.enum(BUILT_IN_IDS)` to `z.string()` with runtime validation against the
  merged registry. Unknown provider errors include the list of known provider ids.

  ***

  **Open docs fetching** in `provider-api-docs`

  `fetchProviderApiDocs` now allows ANY public `https`/`http` URL — not just
  URLs same-origin with registered `docsUrls`/`specUrls`. The SSRF guard and
  byte caps still apply. Registered docs/spec URLs remain available as curated
  starting points in the catalog output. The Dispatch `provider-api-docs` action
  description is updated to reflect this.

  ***

  **New `web-search` agent tool** (`packages/core/src/extensions/web-search-tool.ts`)

  Registers a `web-search` tool in dev and prod agent tool registries:
  - Input: `{ query: string, count?: number (default 5, max 10) }`.
  - **Pluggable backends** — at call time the first configured key wins:
    1. `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY` → Brave Search API
    2. `TAVILY_API_KEY` → Tavily
    3. `EXA_API_KEY` → Exa
       Keys are resolved from the per-user/org credentials store first, then env vars.
  - Returns a title / URL / snippet list with guidance to follow up via
    `web-request` or `provider-api-docs`.
  - If no backend is configured, returns a helpful message listing the three keys.
  - Description: "Search the public web — use to find API docs, endpoints, or
    current information, then fetch promising URLs with web-request or
    provider-api-docs."

  **Framework secret registrations** (`register-framework-secrets.ts`)

  `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY`, `TAVILY_API_KEY`, and `EXA_API_KEY` are registered as
  optional workspace-scoped secrets so they surface in the settings UI.

- 600f83d: Add `saveToFile` and `fetchAllPages` to `provider-api-request` and `saveToFile` to `web-request`.
  - `saveToFile?: string` on `provider-api-request` and `web-request`: writes full response
    body to a workspace file path instead of returning it in context. Allows up to 20 MB
    (vs normal 4 MB). Returns compact summary `{ savedToFile, savedTo, status, bytes, contentType, preview }`.
  - `fetchAllPages?: { cursorPath, cursorParam, itemsPath?, maxPages? }` on `provider-api-request`:
    generic cursor pagination — re-issues requests until cursor is empty or maxPages (default 10,
    max 50) is reached; accumulates items from `itemsPath`. Combines naturally with `saveToFile`.
  - `workspace-files` tool added to sandbox bridge default allowlist.

- 600f83d: Add `workspace-files` module: SQL-backed durable scratch storage for the agent.
  - New `workspace_files` table (scope/scope_id/path/content, unique per scope+path).
  - Per-file 2 MB cap, per-scope 200 MB cap with clear errors.
  - `workspace-files` agent tool (write/append/read/list/delete/grep actions).
  - Tool auto-registered in both dev and prod agent loops.
  - `workspaceRead`, `workspaceWrite`, `workspaceAppend`, `workspaceList` helpers
    available inside `run-code` sandbox via bridge.

## 0.46.0

### Minor Changes

- 66f8e32: Real-time collaboration improvements: security scoping, server performance, and client transport.

  **Security**
  - Tag collab poll events with `owner`/`orgId` when `resourceType` is configured so `getChangesSinceForUser` scopes delivery — users without access no longer receive Yjs bytes.
  - Awareness routes (`POST /awareness`, `GET /users`) already required a session; they now additionally enforce the configured resource access check.
  - Add a one-time server warning when `resourceType` is not set (collab events broadcast to all authenticated users).
  - Enforce a 2 MB payload limit on all collab write endpoints (`/update`, `/text`, `/search-replace`, `/json`, `/patch`); configurable via `maxPayloadBytes` plugin option.
  - Fix awareness outer-map memory leak: prune empty per-doc maps after all clients expire.

  **Server performance**
  - Remove redundant double DB read per mutation. The old code called `applyStoredState()` unconditionally before every write even on hot-cache hits; mutations now do a single SELECT inside `persistMergedState` (for CAS versioning only).
  - Add Yjs tombstone compaction: when the persisted blob is >4× the freshly encoded state, the GC'd form is stored, preventing unbounded blob growth without background jobs.
  - Cache-miss coalescing: concurrent `getDoc()` callers share a single DB load.

  **Client transport**
  - Debounce and coalesce local Yjs update POSTs (~80 ms) using `Y.mergeUpdates`; flush immediately on `visibilitychange`/`pagehide` and before each poll cycle.
  - State-vector fetches are gated: fetch only on reconnect, ring-buffer gap, or every 15th cycle (not on every cycle).
  - Exponential backoff with jitter (cap ~15 s) on consecutive network errors.
  - SSE fast-path: wire collab events via the existing `/_agent-native/poll-events` EventSource stream; relax poll to ~12 s while SSE is healthy, fall back to 2 s when SSE drops.

- 66f8e32: Add Presence Kit: Liveblocks/collaboration-grade live-cursor and selection primitives.
  - **Fast awareness**: `useCollaborativeDoc` now POSTs awareness state changes within ~150ms (throttled trailing edge) instead of waiting for the 2s poll cycle. The `postAwareness` server handler emits an `AWARENESS_CHANGE_EVENT` that is forwarded through the `/_agent-native/poll-events` SSE stream to connected peers push-style. Polling-only deployments degrade gracefully to poll cadence.
  - **`usePresence(awareness, localClientId)`**: reactive hook that derives `OtherPresence[]` from awareness state. The agent (AGENT_CLIENT_ID) appears as a first-class participant with `isAgent: true`. Returns `setPresence(partial)` to publish arbitrary presence fields (cursor, selection, viewport).
  - **`LiveCursorOverlay`**: absolutely-positioned overlay that renders remote users' cursors from normalized 0–1 coordinates. The agent cursor uses a sparkle icon. Cursors fade out after 10s of inactivity with 120ms CSS transitions.
  - **`RemoteSelectionRings`**: renders colored outline rings + name tags over remotely-selected DOM elements using a `resolveRect` callback.
  - **`useFollowUser`**: invokes a callback when the followed participant's viewport changes, enabling follow-the-cursor navigation.
  - **`PresenceBar`** extended with `onAvatarClick` and `followingEmail` props for follow-mode UI with a blue ring indicator.
  - **`toNormalized` / `fromNormalized`**: coordinate helpers for converting pointer events to/from normalized presence coordinates.
  - **`getAwarenessEmitter` / `emitAwarenessChange` / `AWARENESS_CHANGE_EVENT`**: low-level emitter API for server-side awareness events.
  - Design template (`templates/design`) wired as the flagship consumer: live cursors over the canvas, avatar follow mode, and agent cursor plumbing in `edit-design` / `generate-design` actions.

## 0.45.1

### Patch Changes

- a2a3e52: Add CLI guardrails for unsupported Node versions and typo-like bare commands.
- a2a3e52: Encrypt OAuth tokens at rest. The `oauth_tokens` table previously stored the
  full bundle — including long-lived Google refresh tokens — as plaintext JSON,
  so a leaked DB backup / pg_dump / read replica exposed usable credentials.
  `saveOAuthTokens` now AES-256-GCM-encrypts the bundle with the same key story
  as the secrets vault and per-user credentials; reads decrypt transparently and
  fall back to plaintext for rows written before this change (and for Better
  Auth's mirrored `account` rows). Adds an optional, idempotent
  `db-migrate-encrypt-oauth-tokens` script to re-encrypt existing rows in place.

  Also exposes the AES-256-GCM helpers (`encryptSecretValue`,
  `decryptSecretValue`, `isEncryptedSecretValue`) from `@agent-native/core/secrets`
  and a focused `@agent-native/core/secrets/crypto` subpath, so templates can
  encrypt per-row secret values (e.g. a per-recording share password) that don't
  fit the keyed app_secrets / credentials stores.

- a2a3e52: Harden extension SQL filtering and expose shared secret encryption helpers.
- a2a3e52: fix(mcp): throw on corrupt JSON config instead of silently overwriting with empty object

  `readJsonFile` in `mcp-config-writers.ts` previously swallowed all read/parse errors and returned `{}`, meaning a corrupt or partially-written `~/.claude.json` (or `.mcp.json` / `~/.cowork/mcp.json`) would be silently replaced with only the new `mcpServers` entry — destroying the user's entire Claude Code state. Now only a missing or empty file yields `{}`; a non-empty file that fails to parse throws a descriptive error pointing to the file path and asking the user to fix or move it before re-running.

- a2a3e52: Allow `mcpApp: { compactCatalog: true }` without a `resource` so non-UI actions (read, update, list, share) can be flagged into the compact MCP Apps catalog independently of an iframe embed. Makes `resource` optional on `ActionMcpAppConfig` and updates `defineAction` to preserve the flag when no resource is provided.
- a2a3e52: Clean up ghost slash-command references in plan skills, fix Bidirectional Loop self-contradiction in visual-recap, add get-plan-blocks and Visibility & Sharing guidance to visual-plan, reword legacy "implementation maps" and "proof gates" framing, fix skill index and entry-point descriptions in AGENTS.md, align templates-meta.ts with shared-app-config, add publish-visual-plan and chat-host connector docs, and add context-xray to skills status/update usage.
- a2a3e52: Fix plan install flow: OAuth clients now get a publish token after `agent-native connect`, DEVELOPING.md is kept in standalone scaffolds, the Netlify `ignore` script line is stripped in scaffolds, and migration permission errors point to the app-prefixed DATABASE_URL workaround.
- a2a3e52: Fix nested interactive elements in question-form option previews, theme-aware iframe ink in the html block, click/focus/scroll fixes for annotated-code and diff annotation popovers.
- a2a3e52: Fix CLI safety issues: scope isFirstPartyPlanHost to plan.agent-native.com only, exclude diff headers from countDiffLines, raise waitForPublicRecapImage retry budget to ~20s, detect git failures in collect-diff, guard codex mcp-config against clobbering existing config, require PLAN_RECAP_TOKEN for claude mcp-config, and fix plan-local unknown-area exit code.
- a2a3e52: Fix several PR Visual Recap pipeline reliability issues:
  - **playwright optionalDependency**: add `playwright@^1` as an `optionalDependency` of `@agent-native/core` so consumer repos running `npx @agent-native/core@latest` can take screenshots without manual install steps; the existing dynamic-import fallback chain is preserved.
  - **plan-id continuity**: `buildCommentBody` now threads the last-known plan id (`PREV_PLAN_ID`) into every comment branch (failure, suppressed, tiny) so a transient error never orphans the plan; the failure branch also keeps a labeled stale link to the previous recap.
  - **freshness line**: all comment branches that have a `HEAD_SHA` now emit `_As of \`<short-sha>\`\_` so reviewers can tell whether the recap matches the latest push.
  - **deterministic visibility**: `create-visual-recap` action accepts a `visibility` input (enum `private|org|public`, default `org`) and applies it server-side after import, so the recap is never accidentally private; the agent prompt now passes `visibility: "org"` in the `create-visual-recap` call and demotes `set-resource-visibility` to a fallback note.
  - **playwright browser cache**: adds an `actions/cache` step for `~/.cache/ms-playwright` (keyed on runner OS + playwright major) to avoid re-downloading Chromium on every workflow run.
  - **guard scoping**: the `packages/core/**` self-modifying guard in the gate now only triggers for the `BuilderIO/agent-native` monorepo; consumer repos with an unrelated `packages/core/` directory no longer have their recaps silently gated.

- a2a3e52: Remove legacy Plan skill variants from packaged skill installs, move wireframe guidance into references, add copied-skill status/update metadata, and harden visual recap comments and image embeds.
- a2a3e52: Improve PR Visual Recap setup UX with an optional Plans install prompt, `agent-native recap setup`, and `agent-native recap doctor`.

## 0.45.0

### Minor Changes

- 06397b2: Add DB-free local-files helpers for Agent-Native Plans and Visual Recap prompts.

### Patch Changes

- 06397b2: Fix the Cloudflare Pages deploy build failing on every attempt: externalize `@anthropic-ai/tokenizer` (tiktoken `.wasm`) and `@resvg/resvg-js` (native `.node`) from the worker bundle — esbuild has no loaders for those files, and both import sites already degrade gracefully (char/4 token estimates, SVG OG-image fallback). Teach `isResvgRuntimeUnavailableError` workerd's "No such module" wording so the OG route falls back to SVG instead of erroring. Also guard `e.key.toLowerCase()` keyboard shortcut handlers against undefined `e.key` (autofill/IME keydown events), which crashed the composer in production.
- 06397b2: Prefer the left gutter for annotation hover cards when the right side overflows.
- 06397b2: Stop Neon WebSocket drops from surfacing as unhandled `[object ErrorEvent]` promise rejections. Fire-and-forget DB writes (agent-team run heartbeats and progress saves, desktop-exchange cleanup) now catch and log connection failures with context via a new `describeDbError` helper — which also makes the Neon pool/client error logger print the ErrorEvent's actual message instead of `[object ErrorEvent]`. The server Sentry filter now recognizes bundled SDK chunks (e.g. `/var/task/_libs/@sentry/...`) as non-application frames so SDK-only rejection stacks from serverless bundles are dropped as intended.
- 06397b2: Hide redundant language badges on read-only code surfaces when a filename is already shown, and render code filenames with a muted path prefix.
- 06397b2: Add a lightweight `agent-native reconnect` CLI reauth path and harden remote MCP OAuth auth handling.
- 06397b2: Pass repository context into PR visual recap prompts so generated recaps can link back to their source pull requests.
- 06397b2: Restore split diff defaults for visual recaps and steer key-file recap diffs back to horizontal tabs.
- 06397b2: Show PR Visual Recap generation as an informational GitHub check run while it is running.

## 0.44.4

### Patch Changes

- 5a18db9: Remove the special background tint from the question-form submit footer.
- 5a18db9: Hide JSON explorer bulk actions until hover and disable redundant actions.
- 5a18db9: Keep question-form send menus compact and copy-first without edit-by-prompt chrome.
- 5a18db9: Remember the user's unified/split diff view preference in localStorage.
- 5a18db9: Reduce plan code font sizing.
- 5a18db9: Lock annotated-code hover popovers to the first line of a multi-line annotation range.

## 0.44.3

### Patch Changes

- 5b37b89: Add a 2-minute per-attempt timeout to the Builder.io file upload provider fetch so large-image uploads fail with a clear error instead of hanging indefinitely. Retries on network errors are also now handled consistently with the existing 5xx retry path.

## 0.44.2

### Patch Changes

- 1b6f2f4: Fix apps stuck on the `ClientOnly` loading spinner after sign-in when Vite 8's Rolldown dependency optimizer mis-bundled `recharts` → `es-toolkit` CJS compat (`require_isUnsafeProperty is not a function`). Exclude those packages from `optimizeDeps`, allow workspace root `node_modules` in dev server `fs.allow`, and lazy-load Context X-Ray so the treemap is not on the critical startup path.

## 0.44.1

### Patch Changes

- 9c5ba15: Block-library refinements: `ApiEndpointBlock`, `AnnotatedCodeBlock`, `DiffBlock`,
  and the `diagram` block (with added test coverage), plus shared `blocks.css`
  adjustments. No public API changes — these tighten rendering and styling of the
  shared plan/content blocks that live in core.
- 9c5ba15: Fix blank text in the default social/OG preview image (`/_agent-native/og-image.png`).
  Linux serverless runtimes (Netlify/Lambda) ship neither Arial nor Inter, so resvg
  had no font to render with and every `<text>` element came out empty — the card
  showed only the logo and grid. The renderer now bundles Liberation Sans (a
  metric-compatible Arial replacement) embedded as base64 and passes it to resvg via
  `fontFiles`, independent of host system fonts. Also fixes the display title
  rendering thin: resvg's fontdb maps `font-weight: 850` to Regular, so the title now
  uses `800`, which resolves to Bold.
- 9c5ba15: Composer: pasting an HTML document now behaves like uploading that `.html` file.
  Page-sized pastes already convert to a "Pasted text" attachment chip, but the
  composer only ever read the clipboard's `text/plain` flavor and labelled the chip
  a generic `pasted-text-*.txt`. When a user pasted HTML to host as an extension,
  the agent received a nondescript text blob — so instead of reading it verbatim via
  `contentFromAttachment`, it re-emitted the markup inline as a tool argument, which
  cut off mid-stream on large files and degenerated into a continuation loop (the
  chat "spun for a while"). Uploading the same content as a file worked because the
  file carried the real HTML with a recognizable name/type.

  `TiptapComposer`'s paste handler now captures the clipboard's `text/html` flavor
  and, when the pasted content is an HTML document/source, stores it as a real
  `pasted-text-*.html` attachment (`text/html`) with the markup preserved verbatim —
  so paste and file-upload travel the identical attachment rail. Plain prose and
  code stay `.txt` (the detection keys off the pasted content, not the `text/html`
  flavor, so editor syntax-highlight markup and Google Docs formatting don't
  mis-promote plain code/prose to HTML).

- 9c5ba15: Capture LLM token usage and a derived cost estimate for PR Visual Recaps. The
  recap workflow now emits machine-readable usage from the Claude Code / Codex run
  and a new `agent-native recap usage` CLI subcommand parses it (normalizing the
  Anthropic-vs-OpenAI cache-token accounting asymmetry) and attaches it to the
  published recap. `recordUsage` gains optional `refId` (idempotent
  replace-on-rewrite) and `costCentsX100` (store a provider-reported cost
  verbatim) fields plus a `ref_id` column, and the model pricing table gains
  OpenAI `gpt-5` / `gpt-5.5` rows so Codex recaps are not priced as Sonnet.

## 0.44.0

### Minor Changes

- 4e55e6d: Consolidate the plan block set into the shared core block library so any app that
  registers the library (plan, content, future templates) gets the same rich blocks
  — and cut the redundant `decision` block.
  - Moved into the shared library: `callout`, `question-form`, `visual-questions`,
    `diagram`, and `wireframe` (plus the wireframe-kit primitives in
    `library/wireframe-kit.tsx`). Each ships a React-free `*.config.ts` (schema +
    MDX) and a `*.tsx` (`Read`/`Edit` + spec), is registered in both
    `libraryBlockSpecs` (client) and `libraryBlockConfigs` (server), and is exported
    from the blocks entry. They're decoupled from any single app: no shadcn imports
    in core (popovers go through `ctx.renderEditSurface`), and HTML-bearing blocks
    self-sanitize via the shared `library/sanitize-html.ts` (DOM-based in the
    browser, regex fallback on the server).
  - The shared block CSS "contract" now lives in core `styles/blocks.css` (imported
    by `agent-native.css`): block label / code-surface / prose / annotation rules,
    the `text/bg/border-plan-*` color utilities, the app-neutral `an-callout` tone
    styling, and the wireframe-kit + inline-diagram styling — all resolving against
    shadcn theme tokens (with plan-var-with-theme-token fallbacks for the migrated
    wireframe/diagram CSS) so blocks render in any app's palette. Because
    `blocks.css` loads before a template's `global.css`, the plan template's
    existing rules still win there, so plan renders unchanged.
  - `BlockRenderContext` gains optional `onQuestionFormSubmit(summary)` so the
    shared question-form / visual-questions blocks route answers back to the host
    without app-specific wiring.
  - `BlockRegistry.register` now OVERRIDES on a duplicate block `type`/`tag`
    (last-registration-wins) instead of throwing — lets an app override a library
    block and makes module-level registration idempotent under dev HMR (which
    otherwise crashed with "Block type … is already registered").
  - Removed the `decision` block (it duplicated a `callout` with `tone:"decision"`
    plus a `columns`/list comparison). It's gone from the registry, agent
    vocabulary, slash menus, and the plan skills (which now steer to callout +
    columns). Because `decision` was also a legacy member of plan's stored-content
    schema, a content migration rewrites any stored decision block into a
    decision-tone `callout` on load (question + options in the body, recommended
    flagged) so existing plans keep loading and rendering. `callout`'s `decision`
    tone is retained.

### Patch Changes

- 4e55e6d: Plan/editor block drag-handle menu now uses real Tabler icons instead of
  hand-drawn CSS pseudo-element glyphs. The Delete item rendered a malformed,
  oversized trash shape; Duplicate, Delete, and Insert-block-below now inline the
  verbatim Tabler `copy`, `trash`, and `plus` outline SVGs (matching the
  framework-wide `@tabler/icons-react` set), and the left-margin grip uses Tabler
  `grip-vertical`. The editor is plain DOM (not React), so the markup is inlined
  rather than imported. Removed the now-unused `--duplicate`/`--delete`/`--insert`
  pseudo-element drawing rules from the injected menu stylesheet.
- 4e55e6d: Make the agent sidebar paint faster, especially for a new chat.
  - **New chat no longer shows a loading skeleton.** The empty state previously
    rendered a suggestion skeleton that was gated on `suggestionsLoading` — which
    waits on four `application-state` reads (and re-runs every 2s). Suggestions are
    non-essential garnish, so the empty state (icon + composer) now renders
    immediately and suggestion chips appear when ready, instead of holding a
    skeleton on a brand-new chat that has nothing to load.
  - **Opening an existing thread clears its skeleton sooner.** Thread restore no
    longer gates first paint on the `reconnectActiveRunForThread()` probe: the
    skeleton clears as soon as the persisted messages are imported, and the
    active-run reconnect (only relevant mid-run, e.g. after a hot reload) runs
    afterward and streams on top of the already-rendered conversation.

- 4e55e6d: Speed up the agent sidebar and per-session polling.
  - **Chat thread list** (`chat-threads/store.ts`): the sidebar list query no longer
    selects the full `thread_data` JSON blob (every thread's entire message
    history, tool results, and attachments) just to render titles and previews —
    it now reads only the summary columns and derives "has messages" from the
    `message_count` column instead of a `LIKE '%"messages"%'` scan over the blob.
    Legacy rows are backfilled once so none drop out of the list. Added
    `(owner_email, updated_at)` and `(scope_type, scope_id, updated_at)` indexes on
    `chat_threads` so the list is an indexed lookup instead of a full table scan +
    sort. The thread detail/get path still returns the full `thread_data`, and the
    compare-and-swap write path is unchanged. Indexes target Postgres.
  - **Change-detection poll** (`server/poll.ts`): the independent reads in
    `doCheckExternalDbChanges()` now run concurrently via `Promise.all` instead of
    sequential awaits, cutting per-poll round-trips on the common path from ~6 to
    effectively 1. Dependent/conditional follow-up queries stay ordered, and
    change-emit order, early-exit semantics, and error handling are unchanged.

- 4e55e6d: Add a `performance` agent skill (DB-provider-agnostic) covering the load-speed
  best practices apps and templates should follow: project columns on list
  endpoints (never `SELECT *` heavy blobs), index hot-path queries
  (`owner_email`/`org_id`/sort, `*_shares.resource_id`, child foreign keys, status
  filters) via the versioned migration array, avoid N+1 and round-trip waterfalls,
  poll cheaply, don't recompute on every read, and paginate unbounded lists. The
  skill ships into generated workspaces via `workspace-core` and is cross-linked
  from `storing-data`.
- 4e55e6d: `SharedRichEditor` / `createSharedEditorExtensions` gain an optional
  `disableHistory` flag that turns off StarterKit's built-in undo/redo
  (prosemirror-history) for a controlled, non-collaborative editor whose host owns
  its own undo authority. Defaults to `false`, so every existing embedder is
  unchanged; when a collaborative `ydoc` is present, undo/redo stays disabled
  regardless (Yjs owns history, as before). The plan editor uses this so a single
  app-level undo stack — over its authoritative `blocks[]` tree, which holds block
  data the ProseMirror doc never stores — can be the sole cmd+z authority, fixing
  undo/redo for block drag-reorder, cross-region moves, and block option/config
  edits (none of which PM history could see or reliably revert).
- 4e55e6d: Stop a lagging content poll from briefly reverting a just-applied local edit in
  the shared rich-markdown reconcile (`useCollabReconcile`).

  When a structural edit (e.g. a Notion-style drag-to-columns) is applied locally
  and the editor is then blurred — the drag grips the handle, not the prose, so
  `isFocused` is false at drop time — a `get-visual-plan`/source poll that
  re-supplies the older pre-edit content (older-or-equal `contentUpdatedAt`) was
  applied through `setContent`, reverting the new layout. A moment later the save
  round-tripped and the next poll restored it: the "drop works, then undoes, then
  comes back" glitch.

  The reconcile already dropped older-or-equal external content while focused (a
  real peer/agent edit is always newer and retries). In NON-COLLAB editors there
  is no peer, so older-or-equal content is ALWAYS a stale poll/echo — it is now
  dropped regardless of focus (gated on having already seeded, so the first apply
  still lands). Collab editors are unchanged: a peer edit arriving while you are
  away still applies.

- 4e55e6d: Reduce agent-sidebar chat jank by skipping redundant thread re-imports on poll
  ticks (`AssistantChat`'s `importThreadData`).

  The real-time sync layer refetches the open thread (`/threads/:id`, or re-runs a
  host `loadHistoryRepository`) on reconnect, on `historyReloadKey` bumps, and on
  restore. Each call ran the full `JSON.parse` + `normalizeThreadRepository` +
  `threadRuntime.export()`/`import` round-trip even when the payload was identical
  to what was last imported — CPU-bound on long threads and a source of needless
  re-render churn.

  `importThreadData` now hashes the raw incoming payload and short-circuits when it
  matches the last successfully-imported signature, returning the already-imported
  repo. Any real change (new message, arriving tool result, server replacing an
  optimistic copy, switching threads) produces a different signature and falls
  through to a full import. Payloads that `shouldImportServerThreadData`
  deliberately rejects are not cached, so rejection semantics and live token
  streaming are unchanged.

## 0.43.0

### Minor Changes

- 4682bb6: Move the full plan-specific block set into the shared core block library so any
  app that registers the library (plan, content, future templates) gets every rich
  block — not just plan.
  - New shared library blocks: `callout`, `decision`, `question-form`,
    `visual-questions`, `diagram`, and `wireframe` (plus the wireframe kit
    primitives in `library/wireframe-kit.tsx`). Each ships a React-free
    `*.config.ts` (schema + MDX) and a `*.tsx` (`Read`/`Edit` + spec), is added to
    both `libraryBlockSpecs` (client) and `libraryBlockConfigs` (server), and is
    exported from the blocks entry. They are decoupled from the plan app: no
    `@/components/ui` / shadcn imports (popovers go through `ctx.renderEditSurface`),
    and HTML-bearing blocks self-sanitize via the new
    `library/sanitize-html.ts` (DOM-based in the browser, regex fallback on the
    server) instead of relying on a host-wired hook.
  - The shared block CSS "contract" now lives in core `styles/blocks.css`
    (imported by `agent-native.css`): the generic block label/columns/code-surface/
    prose/annotation rules, the `text/bg/border-plan-*` color utilities, the
    app-neutral `an-callout` tone styling, and the wireframe-kit + inline-diagram
    styling. Colors resolve against shadcn theme tokens (`--foreground`,
    `--muted-foreground`, `--border`, `--muted`) — or, for the migrated wireframe/
    diagram CSS, against plan vars with theme-token fallbacks — so the blocks render
    in any app using that app's palette. Because `blocks.css` loads before a
    template's `global.css`, the plan template's existing rules still win there, so
    plan renders unchanged.
  - `BlockRenderContext` gains an optional `onQuestionFormSubmit(summary)` hook so
    the shared question-form/visual-questions blocks can route answers back to the
    host without importing app-specific submit wiring.
  - `BlockRegistry.register` now OVERRIDES on a duplicate block `type`/`tag`
    (last-registration-wins) instead of throwing. This lets an app override a
    shared library block with its own variant and makes module-level registration
    idempotent under dev HMR (which could otherwise re-run a registration module
    against a surviving registry and crash with "Block type … is already
    registered"). A stale MDX-tag mapping is dropped when a re-registered type
    changes its tag.

  Plan's local registration of these blocks (client + server) is removed in favor
  of the shared library copies; plan now registers no app-only blocks.

### Patch Changes

- 4682bb6: Make the Notion-style side drop (drag a block to a neighbour's left/right edge to
  build columns) reliably hittable for a real human in the `DragHandle` extension.

  The side (column) activation region was a thin edge sliver in the vertical
  middle: 28% of the block width capped at 140px, AND only the middle 60% of the
  height. On a typical ~820px plan block that left two ~17%-wide edge zones in a
  35px-tall band as the only column targets — the entire centre and the top/bottom
  slivers reordered instead. A natural "drag beside" gesture released over the
  block body, so it almost always reordered and "dragging side by side never made
  columns" (and even when the indicator flashed, a human's release drifted out of
  the tiny zone before mouse-up).
  - Each side zone now claims ~a third of the block width (`SIDE_DROP_ZONE_RATIO`
    0.28 → 0.33, max cap 140 → 320px, min 48 → 56px) and is clamped to at most 45%
    of the width so a centre before/after reorder lane always survives.
  - Side zones now span the FULL block height (the vertical-middle-only band is
    removed) — only the horizontal position decides column-vs-reorder.
  - The drop indicator gets a `notion-drop-indicator--column` modifier class and is
    drawn as a thicker (4px) vertical bar centred on the seam, so apps can style
    column-build mode distinctly from the thin horizontal reorder line.

  Editors that do not opt into `handleDrop` (e.g. the content editor) are
  unaffected — side placements stay gated on `handleDrop` existing.

  Also fixes the drag grip disappearing before you can grab blocks that are not
  flush with the page's left gutter (a right column, a tab body). Their grip sits
  in a gap the neighbour's wide forgiving hover zone also claims, so moving the
  cursor from the block body toward its grip re-picked hover to the neighbour and
  the grip vanished mid-approach. A grip keepalive now holds the shown grip while
  the cursor travels left of that block's content toward its glyph (bounded to the
  block's own row), so the grip stays grabbable — without changing the
  innermost-wins or gutter-grab behaviour over content.

- 4682bb6: Refine the `file-tree` block for the recap "Files touched" rail. Folder/file
  rows and the summary title drop a touch (14px → 13px) so the dense explorer
  reads a step below body text. The block now sets `data-files-expanded` on its
  root while a file's note/snippet is the reader's active focus, which the plan
  left rail uses to widen into a flyout over the document and collapse back to a
  slim rail when focus leaves or the last open file is closed.
- 4682bb6: Plan renderer + skill polish from review feedback:
  - `checklist` block read view now wraps long item labels instead of clipping
    them off the right edge (`min-w-0 flex-1` body, `shrink-0` marker,
    `break-words`), and tightens the inter-item gap from `gap-3` to `gap-2`.
  - Plan skill `DOCUMENT_QUALITY_CORE` (shared by `/visual-plan` and `/ui-plan`)
    now states that the bottom `question-form` is the ONLY place that enumerates
    open questions — a one-line pointer in the overview is fine, but the question
    list must not be reproduced as a second "Open Questions" section earlier in
    the document.

## 0.42.0

### Minor Changes

- 58676e6: `app-skill` packer now generates auto-updating plugin manifests so installed plugins pick up skill changes without a manual re-pack: Claude Code marketplace entries set `autoUpdate: true` (with commit-SHA plugin versioning) and Codex plugin versions embed a content hash of the bundled skills plus the MCP endpoint. This backs distributing the Agent-Native Plan app (and any app-backed skill) as a one-install Claude Code / Codex marketplace plugin that bundles the skills and the hosted MCP connector together.

### Patch Changes

- 58676e6: Fix fresh-install scaffold builds failing on `@assistant-ui/tap/react-shim`.
  Newly published `@assistant-ui/store@0.2.14` bumped its `@assistant-ui/tap` peer
  to `^0.6.0` and started importing the `@assistant-ui/tap/react-shim` subpath,
  which exists **only** in tap 0.6.0. But `@assistant-ui/react@0.12.x` (our pin)
  still depends on `@assistant-ui/tap@^0.5.x`, so the single hoisted tap resolves
  to 0.5.14 — which has no `react-shim` export. A lockfile-less `pnpm install`
  (the scaffold E2E CI job and any freshly-created app) floated `store` to 0.2.14
  and the calendar build then failed under Rolldown/Vite with:

  ```
  "./react-shim" is not exported … from package @assistant-ui/tap
  ERR_PNPM_RECURSIVE_RUN_FIRST_FAIL  calendar@ build: `agent-native build`
  ```

  Pin `@assistant-ui/store` to `0.2.13` (the latest release that still peers
  `@assistant-ui/tap@^0.5.x` and does not import `react-shim`) and add an explicit
  `@assistant-ui/tap@^0.5.14` so the whole `@assistant-ui/*` family resolves to a
  self-consistent, tap-0.5.x generation (react 0.12.28 · store 0.2.13 · core
  0.1.17 · tap 0.5.14) on a clean install. No app-code changes — assistant-ui
  is consumed exactly as before.

- 58676e6: Before/after comparisons in plans and visual recaps now label their states with
  the column header instead of a pill baked into the wireframe, and wide frames
  stack instead of cropping.
  - The `columns` block renders each column's `label` (e.g. `Before` / `After`) as
    a small `<h4 class="plan-columns-label">` heading **above** that column, in
    both the read and edit surfaces. The state name lives outside the content, so
    authors no longer write a `Before`/`After` pill inside a child wireframe's
    mockup (where it read as part of the product UI and landed in a random corner).
  - A comparison whose columns hold a wide wireframe (`surface: "desktop"` or
    `"browser"`) now lays out as a single vertical stack at full document width
    instead of two half-width cells, so a large frame is never squeezed and
    cropped. Narrow surfaces (`mobile`, `popover`, `panel`) stay side by side.
  - The `visual-plan` / `ui-plan` / `visual-recap` skills' shared Wireframe Quality
    core is updated to teach this: name states with the column header (never inside
    the frame) and let the surface choose side-by-side vs. stacked.

- 58676e6: Rich-markdown drag handle: make container blocks (`columns`, and any nested-region
  block) draggable to reorder again. Each column inside a `columns` block mounts its
  own nested editor that tiles the container's full footprint and extends an 8rem
  forgiving hover zone into the container's left-margin gutter. The grip's
  "smallest editor wins" hover arbitration therefore handed the gutter to the inner
  column editor everywhere, so the outer `columns` block (e.g. a before/after
  wireframe pair in a visual plan) could never be selected or dragged.

  Hover arbitration now splits candidates by cursor position: over a block's body
  the innermost (smallest) editor still wins so nested blocks stay grabbable from
  their content, but in the shared left-margin gutter where the grip lives the
  outermost (largest) editor wins so the container can be picked up and reordered.
  Sibling non-container blocks are unaffected.

- 58676e6: `create-extension` and `update-extension` can now host a large pasted file by
  reference. When a user pastes a big HTML/Alpine file and asks to host it as an
  extension, the model passes `contentFromAttachment` (the pasted attachment's
  name, or the literal `"latest"`) instead of copying the whole file into the
  `content` tool argument. The server resolves it from the turn's attachments —
  which the agent loop now threads into each action's `ActionRunContext` — so the
  model never re-emits thousands of tokens of pasted content.

  Re-emitting a large paste as `content` was the root cause of the
  create-extension continuation loop the repetition guard mitigates; this removes
  the need to regurgitate it at all. The inline `content` path is unchanged.

- 58676e6: Registry block-node legacy-block editing. Legacy (unregistered) document blocks
  can now either:
  - render their own self-contained edit overlay via a `legacyBlockSelfEdits`
    side-map predicate — the node view renders the block in edit mode and adds NO
    separate corner edit surface (no pencil/JSON/form popover), so the block owns a
    single control overlay (e.g. an image block with one hover toolbar); or
  - supply a schema-driven form editor via the `renderLegacyBlockEditor` side-map
    hook, rendered in the block-edit popover instead of the raw-JSON fallback.

  The raw-JSON fallback editor's Save button is also right-aligned instead of
  stretching full-width.

- 58676e6: Fix dragging blocks by the grip when they live inside a container block
  (columns/tabs). A container block's node view runs its `onMouseDownCapture`
  block-select handler in its own React root, so its `stopPropagation()` halted the
  native `mousedown` before it ever reached an inner editor's drag-handle grip —
  nested column blocks could not be picked up at all, so dragging a block OUT of a
  column, BETWEEN columns, or onto another block to make new columns silently did
  nothing. Two parts: `clickedInteractiveChild` now treats the drag handle and any
  target inside a nested editor region as interactive (so the container spares a
  mousedown meant for an inner grip), and the grip's icon is now
  `pointer-events:none` so a real mouse-down — which lands on the SVG, not the grip
  `div` — resolves to the grip itself instead of being swallowed.

  Also adds an optional `onEditorReady` callback to the shared rich-markdown editor
  so a host can capture the root editor view (used by the plan editor to rebuild
  the document when a column move dissolves its container).

- 58676e6: PR Visual Recap: make the Codex backend actually work in CI. Two fixes:
  1. **Auth.** The `Run agent (Codex)` step now pipes `OPENAI_API_KEY` into
     `codex login --with-api-key` (writing `~/.codex/auth.json`) before
     `codex exec`, instead of relying on the bare environment variable. On the
     `gpt-5.5` WebSocket transport Codex was dropping the `Authorization` header on
     the `wss` path and its HTTPS fallback, so every recap failed with `401 Missing
bearer or basic authentication in header` and the PR comment reported
     "generation failed".
  2. **Sandbox + approvals.** `codex exec` now runs with
     `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` instead of
     `--sandbox workspace-write`. Codex's bundled bubblewrap sandbox cannot
     initialize on the GitHub runner, so every shell command failed at startup and
     the agent could not read `recap.diff`; and under an approval gate the
     write-side plan MCP call (`create-visual-recap`) was auto-cancelled. The
     runner is itself an ephemeral throwaway sandbox, so this is the documented CI
     invocation.

  Both fixes land in the in-repo workflow and the bundled copy the CLI writes into
  consumer repos (kept byte-identical by the recap sync test).

- 58676e6: PR Visual Recap: restore the inline screenshot in the sticky PR comment. The
  recap's PNG upload to `POST /_agent-native/recap-image` was silently failing, so
  `recap shot` returned an empty `imageUrl` and the comment fell back to a
  link-only body.

  Root cause: h3 v2's `readRawBody(event, false)` resolves a bare `Uint8Array`,
  not a Node `Buffer`. The route then called Buffer-only methods on it — the PNG
  magic-byte check (`Buffer#equals`) _threw_ (`.equals` doesn't exist on a
  `Uint8Array`), surfacing as a 500 so the CLI saw `!res.ok`; and even past that,
  the store's `png.toString("base64")` would have silently mis-encoded the bytes
  (a bare `Uint8Array` ignores the encoding argument). The upload route now
  normalizes the body to a `Buffer` once before the magic-byte check and storage,
  so both the raw `image/png` and JSON `{ pngBase64 }` paths persist the exact
  bytes uploaded.

  `recap shot`'s image-upload helper now also logs the HTTP status / response
  snippet to stderr on failure (stdout still carries only the machine-readable
  JSON the workflow parses), so a future upload failure is debuggable from the CI
  log instead of vanishing into a null `imageUrl`. The route's unit test mock now
  mirrors h3 v2 by handing the handler a real `Uint8Array`, which would have
  caught the original regression.

- 58676e6: Recap code-diff blocks: fix duplicate/loading tab content, render per-diff
  descriptions, and steer recaps toward a labeled "Key changes" section.
  - **Diff `summary` now renders as a description above the code** (previously a
    trailing note below it), so a one-line "what this hunk changes and why" reads
    before the diff — the natural order for a review recap.
  - **`visual-recap` skill** now instructs the recap generator to give every
    `diff` a one-line `summary`, and to introduce a group of file diffs with a
    `## Key changes` rich-text heading rather than relying on a `tabs` block title.
    All four skill copies stay byte-identical (guarded by `skills.sync.spec.ts`).

  These pair with a plan-template fix where switching tabs in a vertical `tabs`
  block (the recap "Key changes" diff rail) reused one nested editor instance, so
  its content reconciler skipped re-applying the newly-selected tab — surfacing as
  "every tab shows the same diff" and a stuck "Loading diff block…". The nested
  editor is now keyed per container region so each tab remounts with its own
  content.

- 58676e6: Agent chat now bails out of a degenerate repetition loop quickly instead of
  burning the entire auto-continuation budget. When the model gets stuck
  re-streaming the same narration every continuation without ever finishing a
  tool (the classic "paste a large HTML file and ask to host it as an extension"
  failure), it previously counted each repeat as progress and ran all 32 transient
  continuations — re-sending the large pasted payload each round — before surfacing
  a generic `connection_error`. A new repetition guard detects the non-advancing
  loop and stops after a few rounds with a clear, actionable message, and the
  `create-extension` large-payload nudge now also fires on mid-stream cutoffs
  (`stream_ended`), not just run timeouts.
- 58676e6: The `/visual-plan` skill now prescribes a gated, read-only, non-blocking
  adversarial self-review before handoff: surface the plan first, then spawn one
  skeptical reviewer (concurrently, against the written plan only — no
  re-research) for high-stakes architecture/backend/data/multi-file plans, apply
  clear-cut fixes via `update-visual-plan` patches, and route genuine judgment
  calls back to the user. Plan Discipline also gains a reuse-first instruction
  (name what each step reuses before what it adds) and a "decide the hard-to-
  reverse bets first" instruction (settle wire format, public ids, data-model
  shape, auth, and ownership before scoping to the smallest first cut). The
  guidance is byte-synced across the shipped skill constant, the template copy,
  and the exported mirror.

## 0.41.1

### Patch Changes

- 0ce463c: Constrain `@assistant-ui/store` (`>=0.2.9 <0.2.14`) and `@assistant-ui/tap` (`^0.5.14`) as direct dependencies so the breaking `store@0.2.14`/`tap@0.6.0` combination can't be selected transitively via `@assistant-ui/react@^0.12.x`. This prevents the `./react-shim` / `./react` export resolution failures during Vite dependency pre-bundling and production builds.

## 0.41.0

### Minor Changes

- 520d641: Add global (admin) hide for extensions. The `tools` table gains additive
  `hidden_at` / `hidden_by` columns (distinct from the existing per-user
  `tool_hidden_extensions` hide). When set, the extension is hidden from
  everyone's Extensions list/sidebar without being deleted.
  - `listExtensions` now excludes globally-hidden extensions by default and
    accepts `includeGloballyHidden: true` to surface them.
  - New store helpers `globalHideExtension` / `globalUnhideExtension` (require
    owner/admin access) and new agent actions `global-hide-extension` /
    `global-unhide-extension`. `list-extensions` accepts `includeGloballyHidden`
    and reports `globallyHidden` / `hiddenAt` / `hiddenBy` per extension.
  - The extensions list endpoint accepts `?includeGloballyHidden=true`.
  - The Extensions sidebar and list page add a "Hide from everyone" /
    "Unhide for everyone" affordance for admins plus a "Show hidden" toggle.

- 520d641: Notion-style code blocks for the shared editor and plan surfaces. The rich
  markdown editor's fenced code blocks now render through a shared
  `createCodeBlockNode` node view with a language picker header (Auto-detects by
  default) instead of a bare highlighted `<pre>`, and the editor code surface
  follows the app's light/dark `--muted`/`--foreground`/`--border` tokens instead
  of a hardcoded dark navy. The read-side `CodeSurface` (code tabs, API specs,
  markdown read view) gains a language label and collapses long snippets behind a
  "Show N more lines" toggle (default 30 lines, configurable per code tab via the
  new `maxLines` field, `0` to disable) rather than scrolling a fixed-height box.
  New exports: `createCodeBlockNode`, `DEFAULT_CODE_LANGUAGES`, `CodeSurface`,
  `HighlightedCode`, `prettyLanguageName`, `DEFAULT_CODE_MAX_LINES`.
- 520d641: PR Visual Recap is now LLM-driven. Instead of a deterministic diff→MDX
  generator, the `pr-visual-recap` GitHub Action runs the repo's `visual-recap`
  skill via a real coding agent (Claude Code by default, or Codex — selected with
  the `VISUAL_RECAP_AGENT` repo variable), which publishes the plan through the
  plan MCP tools. The workflow screenshots the published plan in headless Chrome,
  uploads it to the new signed `recap-image` route, and posts the screenshot
  inline in the sticky PR comment.

  New CLI surface backing the action:
  - `agent-native recap <scan|build-prompt|shot|comment>` — the helper commands
    the workflow calls (no helper scripts are copied into the consuming repo).
  - `agent-native skills add visual-plan --with-github-action` — installs the PR
    Visual Recap workflow into a repo and prints the secrets/variables to set.

  The agent-produced plan URL is treated as untrusted throughout: the screenshot
  CLI only forwards the publish token to requests whose origin matches the plan
  app (so a poisoned `recap-url.txt` can't exfiltrate it to a third party or via
  cross-origin subresources), and the workflow passes the URL through the
  environment rather than `${{ }}` shell interpolation. The workflow runs on PRs
  into any base branch (not just `main`) so the generated workflow works in repos
  with a different default branch.

- 520d641: Add a standard `code` dev-doc block: a single syntax-highlighted snippet
  (Notion-style — one border, hover-revealed language switcher + copy button,
  collapse-to-N-lines) with an optional filename header. It is the primitive code
  block; a multi-file "rail" is just a `tabs` block containing `code` blocks, so
  there is no bespoke container. The legacy `code-tabs` block stays renderable for
  stored documents but is no longer authored. The pure schema/MDX config lives in
  `code.config.ts` (React-free, safe for the server MDX adapter and SSR bundle).

### Patch Changes

- 520d641: annotated-code: mute the per-annotation line-range label (`LINES 3–6` / `LINE 8`) to a quiet gray (`text-plan-muted`) instead of bright amber, so the range reads as secondary metadata and the annotation label stays the focus.
- 520d641: Plans docs now lead with the two-command story — `/visual-plan` (plan before
  implementation) and `/visual-recap` (review a change that already landed).
  Documented `/visual-recap` on the Plans (`template-plan`) and Visual Plans pages,
  cross-linked PR Visual Recap, and stopped documenting the `/ui-plan`,
  `/prototype-plan`, `/plan-design`, and `/visual-questions` companion commands as
  separate surfaces (their capabilities are folded into `/visual-plan`). The skills
  themselves are unchanged.
- 520d641: Re-add and redesign the `annotated-code` dev-doc block for Plans/Content (block
  source, client/server registries, schema, slash menu, and skill guidance).

  The read view now renders a standard syntax-highlighted code surface (shared
  `code-highlight` lowlight palette, matching the `code-tabs` block) with a
  highlight band + accent rail on annotated line ranges and the notes as
  always-visible cards to the side (Stripe-docs "explain this code" layout).
  Code lines render as spans rather than one `<pre>` per line, so they no longer
  pick up document code/pre chrome, and the surface is theme-aware in light and
  dark. Restores the block removed in the previous patch while keeping the SSR
  cold-start smoke test.

- 520d641: Add a signed, content-only recap PNG image route so the PR visual-recap GitHub
  Action can inline a recap screenshot into a (private-repo) PR comment.
  - `POST /_agent-native/recap-image` stores a PNG (raw `image/png` bytes or JSON
    `{ pngBase64 }`, capped at ~5 MB) and returns
    `{ imageUrl: "<origin>/_agent-native/recap-image/<token>.png" }`. It
    authenticates with the SAME `agent-native connect` bearer token the MCP /
    action surface accepts (legacy `sessions` bearer or a connect-minted MCP
    OAuth access token, audience-bound to this app's MCP resource via the
    canonical `verifyAuth`), plus normal browser session cookies. Unauthenticated
    callers get a 401.
  - `GET /_agent-native/recap-image/<token>.png` serves the opaque bytes
    anonymously (so GitHub's camo image proxy can fetch them) with a strict
    `Content-Type: image/png` and a long immutable cache header. Tokens are 32+
    hex chars (no directory traversal); unknown tokens 404. The interactive plan
    stays login-gated.

  Storage is a new additive Postgres `recap_images` table created via
  `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` (PNG kept as base64 TEXT in Postgres). Stored
  images are pruned on write past a
  30-day TTL so the table and the set of anonymously-fetchable image URLs stay
  bounded.

## 0.40.2

### Patch Changes

- 8ea7f6d: Remove the annotated-code dev-doc block from Plans/Content (block source,
  client/server registries, schema, slash menu, and skill guidance).

## 0.40.1

### Patch Changes

- 38dff5b: Fix production 502s on SSR apps (docs, slides, content, assets) caused by the
  browser-only Excalidraw/Mermaid renderers leaking into the Nitro server bundle.
  Nitro re-bundles the server from node_modules and Rolldown merged
  `@excalidraw/excalidraw` into a shared vendor chunk that the SSR render path
  (tiptap, radix-ui, recharts) imported statically, so its top-level `window`
  access ran at function cold-start and crashed every request with
  `ReferenceError: window is not defined`. The Vite SSR build already stubbed these
  libs for `build/server`, but that plugin didn't run during Nitro's separate
  bundle. The deploy build now mirrors the same stub as a Rolldown plugin, replacing
  `@excalidraw/excalidraw`, `@excalidraw/mermaid-to-excalidraw`, and `mermaid` with
  an inert proxy in the server bundle (they only ever render client-side).

## 0.40.0

### Minor Changes

- 2ce5471: Add a reusable `columns` container block for side-by-side (before/after) layouts in visual plans.
- 2ce5471: Promote `/visual-recap` into the Agent-Native Plans skill bundle with CLI
  installer aliases and synced skill copies.

### Patch Changes

- 2ce5471: Scope block edit hover to the directly hovered block and keep generated API reference blocks in a single-column document flow.
- 2ce5471: Expose block metadata to host edit popover renderers so apps can provide
  contextual block-level AI edit actions.
- 2ce5471: Harden shared block renderers against malformed legacy JSON edits, oversized diff inputs, and JsonExplorer expand-state updates.
- 2ce5471: Bound the Neon pooled-connection acquire with a timeout, not just the query. A cold or exhausted Neon pooler can stall on `pool.connect()`, which happens before the query-level `withDbTimeout` can fire — so authenticated requests (which run a session/org lookup on every navigation via `getSession` → `backfillSessionOrg`) hung until the platform killed the function, surfacing as "the app won't load" with lists, org switcher, and team pages stuck loading. The acquire now races the same `DB_OP_TIMEOUT_MS` budget and degrades into a retryable `CONNECT_TIMEOUT`, releasing the connection if it resolves after the timeout so the pool slot isn't leaked.
- 2ce5471: Improve visual plan canvas source formatting guidance and document targeted diagram HTML patching.
- 2ce5471: Highlight code-tab block editors while preserving textarea editing, and infer
  syntax languages from file-like tab labels such as `content.ts`.
- 2ce5471: Limit diff blocks to 15 visible lines by default with a slimmer inline expand
  control, quieter file metadata, and hover-revealed layout controls.
- 2ce5471: Compact single-child folder chains in FileTree blocks, cap the default visible tree rows, and use muted folder icons.
- 2ce5471: Use standard UI label typography for FileTree block paths instead of monospace file text.
- 2ce5471: Fix `zodDefToJsonSchema` to handle Zod v4 `"pipe"` type produced by `z.preprocess()`, `.superRefine()`, and `.transform()`. Previously these fell through to the `{ type: "string" }` fallback, causing action parameters whose schemas use `z.preprocess` (such as `content` in `create-visual-plan`) to be registered as strings in the MCP tool schema. Claude Code and other MCP clients would then JSON-encode object values as strings before sending, breaking validation.
- 2ce5471: Keep shared block tab rails on one horizontally scrollable row when many tabs are present.
- 2ce5471: Improve registry block editing with panel artifacts, inline table editing,
  container edit surfaces, and a drag-handle block action menu.
- 2ce5471: Default JSON explorer blocks to two auto-expanded container levels and add auto-expand presets to the edit popover.
- 2ce5471: Fix Mermaid block runtime loading so Vite rewrites the browser-only Mermaid and
  Excalidraw imports instead of leaving unresolved bare module specifiers in the
  browser.
- 2ce5471: Single-source the shared plan-skill cores (wireframe/canvas/document/exemplar) and share one wireframe-quality core across /visual-plan, /ui-plan, and /visual-recap. The wireframe-quality bar is now identical for forward plans and recaps, and the before/after layout rule is stated once (pick columns vs. vertical stack by geometry), removing the prior /visual-recap contradiction.
- 2ce5471: Keep the full structured block library discoverable in Plans and Content slash
  menus outside Notion-sync mode, including Mermaid, Swagger-style endpoints,
  OpenAPI specs, schema/data models, diffs, file trees, JSON explorers, and
  annotated code. Also let shareable resources normalize access context so local
  Plan ownership stays consistent across generic sharing actions.
- 2ce5471: Polish structured block slash menus with compact descriptions, hidden search
  keywords, one-line ellipsized rows, and keyboard navigation that keeps the active
  item visible while scrolling.
- 2ce5471: Soften the active tab background for shared tabs blocks.
- 2ce5471: Reduce table editing chrome by scoping row and column remove controls to the
  hovered row or header, remove the footer padding control, and edit table text
  through inline rich-markdown cells.
- 2ce5471: Add an optional vertical orientation for the reusable tabs block.
- 2ce5471: Stop generated visual recap plans from adding boilerplate disclaimer and provenance prose blocks.
- 2ce5471: Clarify that visual recaps for UI changes should include wireframes, with before/after used when it helps review the change.

## 0.39.2

### Patch Changes

- fa107db: Clarify generated app guidance so normal app data is action-first, and keep shared framework skills synchronized across generated workspaces and first-party templates.
- fa107db: Fix deploy-time action route discovery so worker/edge builds mount actions with their declared HTTP method and `http.path`.

  The deploy scan previously detected only `method: "GET"` via a plain source-text `includes`, so actions declaring `PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE`/`OPTIONS` were silently registered as `POST` (`app.on("POST", …)`) in deployed builds — a method mismatch against the client's actual request that 404s on edge/worker hosts (affected `calendar`'s `update-external-calendars`/`update-overlay-people` PUTs and `brain`'s `delete-source` DELETE). The same naive scan could also be tripped by an unrelated `method: "GET"` elsewhere in the file (e.g. a `fetch(…, { method: "GET" })` in the action body), and it dropped `http.path` entirely.

  Discovery now parses the `http` config block specifically (all verbs, `http.path`, whitespace-tolerant `http: false`), and the generated worker mounts each action at `${prefix}/${http.path ?? name}` — matching the runtime mount in `action-routes.ts`.

- fa107db: Guide architecture and code visual plans toward flexible inline HTML/SVG
  document diagrams instead of top-level UI canvases, custom HTML escapes, or
  default linear node flows.
- fa107db: Expose auth provider profile images on client sessions and seed Google profile pictures into the shared avatar store.
- fa107db: Fold existing-plan import guidance into `/visual-plan` and stop distributing the separate `/visualize-plan` skill.

## 0.39.1

### Patch Changes

- 24a3a14: Add `/plan-design` to the built-in Plans skill bundle and CLI aliases.

## 0.39.0

### Minor Changes

- d82d5f7: Add a "panel" edit surface for config-driven blocks. A block spec can set
  `editSurface: "panel"` (the default when it ships no custom `Edit`) to render its
  `Read` view with a hover corner edit button that opens its editor — the custom
  `Edit` or the schema-driven auto-form — in an app-provided panel
  (`ctx.renderEditSurface`, e.g. a popover), instead of always-inline fields.
  Direct-manipulation blocks (prose, checklist, table, tabs) stay inline. The core
  `custom-html` block opts into the panel.

  Also completes the schema auto-editor (`SchemaBlockEditor`): array fields now
  render as add/remove repeating rows (object elements → nested field groups,
  scalar elements → per-item inputs) and object fields render as nested fieldsets,
  instead of falling back to a "needs custom Edit" hint.

- d82d5f7: Move the eight "dev-doc" structured blocks into the core block library so any app can register them, mirroring how `checklist` / `code-tabs` / `html` / `table` / `tabs` already live in core.
  - **New shared blocks** — `mermaid` (hand-drawn Mermaid diagram), `api-endpoint` (Swagger / Stripe-style endpoint reference), `openapi-spec` (whole-document OpenAPI / Swagger reference), `data-model` (interactive dbdiagram-style ERD), `diff` (GitHub-style before/after with unified + split views), `file-tree` (VS Code / GitHub explorer with change badges), `json-explorer` (collapsible devtools JSON tree), and `annotated-code` (Stripe-docs "explain this code" walkthrough). Their React-free schema + MDX round-trip config export from `@agent-native/core/blocks/server`; their `Read` / `Edit` React renderers export from `@agent-native/core/blocks`.
  - **App-agnostic** — the renderers no longer depend on a host app's shadcn/ui components or `next-themes`. Form controls use minimal inline primitives styled with the same Tailwind tokens, dark mode is detected from the document root's `.dark` class, and the diff line-differ is inlined so core carries no extra runtime dependency. Rendered output (dark/light, collapse, FK-highlight interactivity, panel editing) is unchanged.

- d82d5f7: Export shared registry-block Tiptap node utilities so app editors can render registered block specs through a common NodeView, side-map provider, and duplicate-id reminting plugin.
- d82d5f7: Add single-document editor primitives to the shared rich-markdown editor so the
  plan app can render its whole document as one editable Notion-style ProseMirror
  doc (custom blocks as inline NodeViews) while keeping its `blocks[]` format:
  `gfmToProseJSON`/`proseJSONToGfm` (GFM↔ProseMirror via a headless editor), a
  `RunId` extension (stable per-block prose ids), the shared `DragHandle` extension
  (block grip + drag-reorder, moved from the content app and parameterized via
  `wrapperSelector`), and serializer-injection props on `SharedRichEditor`
  (`getMarkdown`/`setContent`/`normalizeValue`/`shouldSeed`/`wrapperClassName`).

  The `DragHandle` grip now attaches lazily on first hover (re-homing to the
  wrapper once it exists) instead of only at plugin init, so the grip reliably
  appears even when the editor DOM mounts into its wrapper after the ProseMirror
  view is constructed (the React mount order in `SharedRichEditor`).

### Patch Changes

- d82d5f7: Expose shared library block spec registration for template editors.
- d82d5f7: Add a `notionCompatible` block-spec flag and registry helper so apps can derive Notion-sync block allowlists from registered block metadata.
- d82d5f7: Add a shared registry-block slash-command builder for template editors.
- d82d5f7: Fix rich-text editing data loss in the shared collab reconcile. The reconcile now
  remembers a small bounded ring of recent local emissions, so a stale-but-recent
  poll echo — e.g. a debounced autosave that persisted only a partial burst, then
  re-supplied by the next poll with a newer timestamp — can no longer clobber the
  freshly-typed tail. Previously only the single latest emission was recognized as
  an echo, so the trailing characters typed during the save→poll window were
  reverted. External (agent/peer) edits never byte-match a local emission, so
  agent resync is unaffected.
- d82d5f7: Make the unified editor's block library "add a block in ONE place" by sharing the two pieces that were still duplicated between the plan and content editors.
  - **`buildRegistryBlockSlashItems(registry, options)`** (exported from `@agent-native/core/client`) — the shared builder for the registry-derived block slash commands both editors offer. It owns the `registry.list("block")` source, the Notion-compatibility filter, and the one-item-per-spec mapping; each app injects only the parts that legitimately differ (its item shape, its Notion-compat predicate, and how it inserts the block node). Plan's `buildPlanSlashCommands` and content's `buildRegistrySlashItems` are now thin adapters over it.
  - **`registerLibraryBlocks(registry, { overrides? })` + `libraryBlockSpecs`** (from `@agent-native/core/blocks`) — register the whole standard browser library (checklist, table, code-tabs, html, tabs + the eight dev-doc blocks: mermaid, api-endpoint, openapi-spec, data-model, diff, file-tree, json-explorer, annotated-code) in one call. Apps register it, then add only their app-specific blocks on top, passing small per-block `overrides` (e.g. content re-types `table` → `table-block`).
  - **`registerLibraryBlockConfigs(registry, { overrides? })` + `libraryBlockConfigs`** (from `@agent-native/core/blocks/server`) — the React-free twin for server / shared registries, registering the same library as `Read: () => null` config stubs so the agent schema export and MDX round-trip share one source too.

  Adding a 14th standard library block now means editing one core list instead of four app files. The set of registered blocks and the Notion-gating behavior in each app are unchanged.

- d82d5f7: Update bundled Visual Plans skill guidance to use bottom Open Questions form blocks.

## 0.38.0

### Minor Changes

- 5f51768: Give actions and skills tighter control over what the agent sees, and make the clarifying-question UI a first-class building block.
  - **`agentTool: false` on `defineAction`** — expose an action to the frontend / HTTP (`useActionMutation`, `callAction`, `/_agent-native/actions/<name>`) while hiding it from every agent tool surface (in-app assistant, MCP, A2A, job/trigger runners). Frontend/programmatic actions no longer have to spend a slot in the model's tool list. Distinct from `toolCallable`, which only governs the sandboxed extension iframe bridge.
  - **`ask-question` / `askUserQuestion()`** — the built-in clarifying-question tool now accepts a short `header` chip and per-option `preview` content, aligning with Claude Code's `AskUserQuestion`. A new `askUserQuestion()` client helper (exported from `@agent-native/core/client`) lets app code raise the same inline multiple-choice prompt and `await` the user's selected value(s) — so the UI can gate an action on one quick decision. Documented in `client.md` and the `client-methods` skill.
  - **Skill scoping** — SKILL.md frontmatter now supports `scope: runtime | dev | both` (default `both`). The runtime agent excludes `scope: dev` skills from both the system-prompt skills block and `docs-search`, so development-only skills stay invisible to the running app's agent.
  - **Action-surface guidance + advisory audit** — the `actions` skill and docs now teach keeping the action surface small and orthogonal (prefer one CRUD `update` over per-field actions; reach for the generic query/escape-hatch actions instead of minting read actions). Added `pnpm actions:audit`, an advisory scanner that flags likely UI-dead mutating actions and redundant action clusters (never fails CI).
  - **`run(args, ctx)` context** — an action's `run` now receives an optional second argument with the resolved request identity (`userEmail`, `orgId`) and the invocation source (`caller`: `"tool" | "http" | "frontend" | "cli" | "mcp" | "a2a"`), wired at every dispatch site. Read `ctx.userEmail` / `ctx.caller` instead of calling `getRequestUserEmail()` by hand. Backward compatible (1-arg `run(args)` still valid); `userEmail` is never defaulted to a dev identity.
  - **Client-side `track()`** — analytics tracking now works from the browser. A new `track()` client helper (exported from `@agent-native/core/client`) POSTs to `/_agent-native/track`, which forwards the event to the same registered server-side providers (PostHog/Mixpanel/etc) with server-resolved attribution. No analytics SDK or provider keys ship to the client.

- 510f15d: Add a first-party block registry (`@agent-native/core/blocks`). A `BlockSpec`
  describes one document block end to end — a zod `schema` for its data, an `mdx`
  config for byte-stable MDX round-trip, a `Read` renderer, an optional `Edit`
  (auto-generated from the schema when omitted), and `placement` (top-level
  and/or inline). Apps create a `BlockRegistry`, register their specs, and render
  through `BlockView` inside a `BlockRegistryProvider`.
  - `defineBlock` / `BlockRegistry` / `registerBlocks` — author and register blocks.
  - `BlockRegistryProvider` / `useBlockRegistry` — thread the registry + runtime
    render context (asset resolver, action caller, inline markdown editor) into React.
  - `SchemaBlockEditor` + the `markdown()` zod helper — a schema-driven auto-editor
    that renders shadcn-style controls per field, with `markdown()`-tagged string
    fields editing inline via the app's rich-markdown editor.
  - `serializeSpecBlock` / `parseSpecBlock` + the shared `prop()` encoder and
    estree attribute reader (exported from the React-free
    `@agent-native/core/blocks/server` entry) — registry-driven MDX round-trip that
    reproduces the existing component/attribute encoding for backward compatibility.
  - `describeBlocksForAgent` / `renderBlockVocabularyReference` — generate the
    agent's block vocabulary (per-block JSON schemas and a compact markdown
    reference of types, MDX tags, placement, and key fields) directly from the
    registry so the agent never drifts from what the app can render and serialize.
  - A standard block library (`@agent-native/core/blocks` + the React-free
    `/blocks/server` entry): `checklistBlock`, `tableBlock`, `codeTabsBlock`,
    `htmlBlock`, and `tabsBlock`, each with its pure schema + MDX config so apps
    can register the shared specs (plan registers all of them; tabs is also
    inline-placeable).

  The registry is designed to run alongside existing per-block code: renderers and
  the MDX adapter check the registry first and fall back to legacy paths for
  unregistered block types, so existing documents keep working unchanged.

- 510f15d: Add a standard `tabs` block to the core block library
  (`@agent-native/core/blocks`): a horizontal pill-tab container whose tabs each
  hold their own list of child blocks. It exports `tabsBlock` (the full React
  spec), `TabsBlockReader`/`TabsBlockEditor`, and the React-free
  `tabsSchema`/`tabsMdx` config (from `@agent-native/core/blocks/server`). The MDX
  encoding matches the legacy `<TabsBlock … tabs={[…]} />` form — labels and
  nested child blocks are one JSON `tabs` prop (not nested MDX) — so stored
  documents round-trip byte-compatibly.

  Container blocks render their children through a new optional
  `BlockRenderContext.renderBlock` capability (with a `NestedBlock` shape): the app
  wires it to its own block dispatcher so registered children render via their spec
  and unconverted children fall through the app's legacy path. This is the
  coexistence seam that lets a core container block render app-specific child
  blocks without importing them.

- 510f15d: Syntax-highlight code blocks in the shared rich markdown editor. When an embedder
  enables `features.codeBlock` (Plans today), the editor now uses
  `CodeBlockLowlight` with a curated lowlight grammar set (js/ts/tsx, json, css,
  html, bash, python, yaml, sql, markdown) and a github-dark token theme, instead
  of a plain monospace block. Inline code keeps its own background; block code no
  longer leaks the inline-code background over the dark surface. Apps that ship
  their own code node (Content's NFM editor disables `features.codeBlock`) are
  unaffected.
- 510f15d: Add optional real-time multi-user editing to the shared `RichMarkdownEditor`.

  `RichMarkdownEditor` (and the `createRichMarkdownExtensions` factory) now accept
  optional `ydoc`, `awareness`, and `user` props. When a `ydoc` is supplied the
  editor binds the framework's existing collaboration stack — `Collaboration` over
  the shared `Y.Doc`, plus a `CollaborationCaret` for live cursors when an
  `Awareness` is present — and disables StarterKit's built-in undo/redo so Yjs owns
  history. The lead client (elected via `isReconcileLeadClient`) seeds the empty
  shared doc once from the markdown `value`, `onChange` skips remote-origin
  transactions before serializing, and external markdown is reconciled only by the
  lead client when it is genuinely newer. Markdown (GFM) stays the canonical
  emitted/saved representation — the `Y.Doc` is transient live state and is never
  written into stored content.

  With no `ydoc`, the editor is byte-for-byte the same controlled `value`/`onChange`
  single-user editor as before, so existing embedders are unaffected. This lets a
  template wire per-block collaborative prose editing by pairing the editor with
  `useCollaborativeDoc` and a `createCollabPlugin` mount, reusing the shared collab
  backend instead of reimplementing CRDT sync. New exports:
  `createRichMarkdownExtensions`, `RichMarkdownCollabUser`, and
  `CreateRichMarkdownExtensionsOptions` from `@agent-native/core/client`.

- 510f15d: Add a shared block-level image node to the rich markdown editor core so every
  embedder gets an uploading image block — improve it once, both apps improve.
  - **`features.image` + `onImageUpload`** on `createSharedEditorExtensions` /
    `SharedRichEditor`. When enabled, the editor mounts a block-level image node
    (`@tiptap/extension-image`) that serializes to standard markdown image syntax
    `![alt](src)` for the `gfm` dialect — byte-stable and source-syncable (no
    `<img width>` HTML, so the GFM `html:false` contract and the plan round-trip
    corpus are preserved). The node ships a block-aware markdown serializer so an
    image followed by prose keeps its blank-line separator.
  - **Injectable upload contract** `ImageUploadFn = (file: File) => Promise<{ src;
alt? }>`. A self-contained ProseMirror plugin wires paste-image and
    drag-drop-image to the injected uploader (insert placeholder → upload → patch
    `src`), and `createImageSlashCommand(upload)` adds a `/image` file-picker
    command. With no uploader the block still renders and round-trips pasted image
    URLs / `![](url)` markdown.
  - **`uploadEditorImage`** (exported from `@agent-native/core/client`): the
    default uploader. Reads the File as a data URL and calls the framework
    `upload-image` action, returning the hosted CDN URL — so any consumer gets a
    real uploading image block with no per-app upload code.

  Plans now support inserting images via `/image`, paste, and drag-drop; each
  image autosaves as `![alt](url)` markdown through the existing
  `update-rich-text` path. The Content editor keeps its own richer image block
  (Assets picker, AI alt-text, resize, NFM serialization) unchanged — it leaves
  `features.image` off and injects its own image node, so the two never collide
  and Content's NFM image round-trip stays byte-identical.

- 510f15d: Extract the rich markdown editor into ONE shared, configurable core so the plan
  and content editors can build on a single surface instead of duplicating the
  base Tiptap setup, markdown wiring, collab seed/reconcile logic, and the slash /
  bubble menus.

  New exports from `@agent-native/core/client`:
  - `createSharedEditorExtensions(opts)` — the single extension factory. Assembles
    StarterKit + Placeholder + Link + tasks + tables + a dialect-keyed
    `tiptap-markdown` serializer (`MARKDOWN_DIALECT_CONFIG` for `gfm`/`nfm`), then
    optional Collaboration/CollaborationCaret, then app-injected `extraExtensions`.
    Accepts `{ dialect, preset, placeholder, features, extraExtensions, collab }`,
    plus a `starterKit` override (disable replaced nodes / swap the dropcursor), a
    `markdown` config override, and `features.placeholder` / `features.markdown`
    toggles so an app with a bespoke placeholder resolver or its own serializer
    (Content's NFM converter) can reuse just the StarterKit base + collab wiring.
  - `useCollabReconcile(...)` — the seed / reconcile / lead-client / change-origin
    logic extracted into a reusable hook, so the subtle collab behavior is never
    duplicated again. Returns the `onUpdate` guards (`shouldIgnoreUpdate`,
    `registerEmitted`) plus the `isSettingContent` ref. Accepts `getMarkdown`,
    `setContent`, `normalizeValue`, `shouldSeed`, and `initialAppliedUpdatedAt`
    overrides so a non-`tiptap-markdown` serializer (Content's
    `docToNfm`/`nfmToDoc`/`canonicalizeNfm`, sentinel-`<empty-block/>` seed, and
    stale-Y.Doc-on-open reconcile) round-trips byte-identically through the hook.
  - `SlashCommandMenu` + `DEFAULT_SLASH_COMMANDS` and `BubbleToolbar` +
    `buildDefaultBubbleItems` — the inline menus promoted to standalone,
    extendable components (apps pass their own `items` / `buildItems`).
  - `SharedRichEditor` — the editor component (props: `value`, `onChange`,
    `onBlur`, `contentUpdatedAt`, `editable`, `interactive`, `placeholder`,
    `className`, `editorClassName`, `dialect`, `preset`, `features`,
    `extraExtensions`, `ydoc`, `awareness`, `user`, plus optional `slashItems` /
    `buildBubbleItems` overrides).

  `RichMarkdownEditor` and `createRichMarkdownExtensions` remain exported as
  back-compat aliases over the shared core, preserving today's GFM/plan behavior
  exactly — the round-trip fidelity and collaboration specs stay green and the
  plan editor is unchanged. Content-specific Notion/media/comment/database
  extensions are injected via `extraExtensions`, never forced into the shared
  core.

  Phase 2: the Content (Documents) editor now builds on this same shared core. Its
  `createVisualEditorExtensions` routes through `createSharedEditorExtensions`
  (sharing the StarterKit base + the Collaboration/CollaborationCaret wiring +
  ordering), and its inline collab seed/reconcile/lead-client/`onUpdate`-guard
  logic is replaced by `useCollabReconcile` with Content's NFM serializer injected.
  Content keeps every Notion/media/comment/database/NFM-fidelity behavior as
  `extraExtensions` and its own slash/bubble menus, and its NFM round-trip
  (`docToNfm(nfmToDoc(x)) === x`) stays byte-identical — so plan and content now
  share one editor core.

### Patch Changes

- 510f15d: Show a loading skeleton while the Assets picker iframe is initializing.
- 5f51768: Show `sendToAgentChat({ newTab: true, background: true })` work in RunsTray and ensure hidden background tabs start their queued chat turn without stealing focus.
- 510f15d: Fix a content-corrupting reconcile loop in the shared `useCollabReconcile` hook
  (`RichMarkdownEditor` / `SharedRichEditor` for Plans, and the Content editor that
  reuses the hook with its NFM overrides).

  Two compounding bugs caused a rich-text block to escalate every poll
  (`<h1>…</h1>` → `&lt;h1&gt;…` → `&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;…` …) and fight active typing:
  - **Trigger:** the default `setContent` passed
    `parseOptions: { preserveWhitespace: "full" }`. In tiptap v3 that routes the
    command through `insertContentAt`, which tiptap-markdown ALSO overrides to
    re-run its markdown parser — double-parsing the already-parsed doc and
    re-emitting it as escaped HTML. So even a clean heading/list/code block came
    back non-idempotent and drifted on every reconcile. The default now hands the
    markdown string straight to tiptap-markdown's `setContent` override (no
    `parseOptions`); the GFM corpus round-trips byte-stably, code-block and
    empty-line whitespace included.
  - **Containment:** the reconcile only skipped re-applying when the editor's raw
    serialization equalled the incoming value, so a NON-idempotent value
    (`serialize(parse(value)) !== value`, e.g. raw HTML stored in a block) was
    re-applied indefinitely. The reconcile now compares by DOC EQUIVALENCE: it
    tracks the raw value it last applied and the editor's serialized output after
    that apply, recognizes both a re-supplied raw value and its own autosaved
    serialized echo as already-applied, and re-checks at apply time. A
    non-idempotent block is now applied AT MOST ONCE and the editor stabilizes
    instead of corrupt-looping. External content is also never applied while the
    user is actively typing.

  The idempotent (normal) path, the lead-client election, the `isChangeOrigin`
  skip, and Content's NFM `getMarkdown`/`setContent`/`normalizeValue`/`shouldSeed`
  overrides are unchanged.

- 5f51768: Honor connect-minted MCP OAuth tokens on the HTTP action surface.

  `agent-native connect` mints an MCP-audience OAuth access token and the local
  Plans publish flow POSTs it (as `Authorization: Bearer`) to the hosted action
  route `/_agent-native/actions/import-visual-plan-source`. That token is bound to
  the app's MCP resource, not the legacy `sessions` table, so `getSession` never
  resolved it on the action surface and `requiresAuth` actions like
  `import-visual-plan-source` returned 401 — breaking `publish-visual-plan`.

  `getSession`'s bearer path now falls back to the MCP surface's canonical
  `verifyAuth` for any `Authorization: Bearer` request, so the action surface
  honors exactly the tokens the MCP endpoint honors: same signature check, same
  audience binding to this app's resource, same connect-token revocation gate. It
  resolves to the same `{ email, orgId }` identity, so ownable-data scoping is
  identical. Cookie/page loads (no bearer header) are unaffected, and tokens bound
  to a different app's audience are still rejected.

- 5f51768: Reduce Sentry noise from expected browser auth/abort and reconnect 404 events, and keep social OG images from failing when the native resvg runtime is unavailable.
- 5f51768: Strengthen generated agent instructions to forbid hardcoded API keys, tokens,
  webhook secrets, credential literals, and private data in source, docs,
  fixtures, prompts, action responses, and generated content.
- 510f15d: Improve the hosted Google sign-in warning for Mail by showing it as a popover with a run-local path.
- 5f51768: Super-easy `/visual-plan` setup: `agent-native skills add visual-plan` now
  installs the skill, registers the Plans MCP connector, AND authenticates it in
  one step (reusing the existing `agent-native connect` OAuth / browser
  device-code flow) so you no longer hit an OAuth wall on the first tool call. Add
  a `--no-connect` flag to skip auth, and in non-interactive shells / CI the auth
  step is skipped and the exact `agent-native connect <url>` command is printed
  instead. The unauthorized MCP response (`401`) now returns an actionable JSON
  body with a human-readable message plus the exact remediation (the
  `agent-native connect <url>` command and the authorize / resource-metadata URLs)
  while keeping the `WWW-Authenticate` header for OAuth-capable clients. Adds a
  public docs quick-start page for Visual Plans.
- 5f51768: Correct the `/visual-plan` setup & authentication docs to match the real model.
  The CLI install (`agent-native skills add visual-plan`) installs the skill,
  registers the hosted Plans MCP connector, AND authenticates it in one step (a
  one-time browser sign-in at setup is intended; `--no-connect` skips it) — it does
  not run "no-login local by default". The no-sign-up experience is the
  browser/guest path: anyone you share with can create and edit a plan as a guest
  and only sign in to save or share, at which point their guest plans are claimed
  into their account. Public/shared plans are viewable by anyone with the link;
  commenting requires an agent-native account. Local mode (offline, plans synced to
  your repo as MDX) is documented as a separate advanced path. Updates the shared
  `PLAN_SETUP_AUTH_MD` block across all Plans skills (`/visual-plan`, `/ui-plan`,
  `/visual-questions`, `/visualize-plan`) and the public Visual Plans docs page,
  including its frontmatter description.
- 510f15d: Keep `/visual-plan` and `/ui-plan` on the host agent's normal planning flow,
  using visual questions only for explicit `/visual-questions` intake.
- 5f51768: Add a shared rich markdown editor for inline plan prose editing.
- 5f51768: Plan editor share + side-chat UX: the agent side chat now offers an inline,
  account-free way to paste an Anthropic or OpenAI API key (progressive
  disclosure next to the existing one-click Builder connect) and makes clear the
  side chat is optional — you can keep editing with your own coding agent. Adds a
  `saveAgentEngineApiKey` client helper for storing a bring-your-own provider key.
- 5f51768: Keep generated workspace skills synced from the repository skill source of truth and guard against drift.

- 5d6ef40: Keep the chat shell from waiting on dynamic prompt suggestions, and show a
  three-row suggestion skeleton in empty chats while context-aware suggestions
  load.
- 5d6ef40: Add a "Plan Discipline" section to the exported Plans skills

  `/visual-plan`, `/ui-plan`, and `/visualize-plan` now lead with plan-mode
  process discipline drawn from best-in-class plan modes: right-size when to plan
  (skip trivial work), research the codebase before drafting, keep planning
  read-only, clarify only decision-changing ambiguity before finalizing (otherwise
  state an assumption and proceed), write specific plans with non-goals and a
  closing verification step, and treat the plan as an explicit approval gate before
  any code is written.

## 0.36.0

### Minor Changes

- f424018: Add the Agent-Native Plans `/ui-plan` exported skill and CLI alias for
  UI-first, high-fidelity visual planning.

### Patch Changes

- f424018: Move the Context X-Ray composer meter into a compact popover trigger.
- f424018: Show humanized running tool-call activity and hide argument previews from collapsed tool-call headers.
- f424018: Stop emitting `X-Frame-Options: DENY` from the global security headers middleware, emit iframe-navigation COEP/CORP headers for cross-origin isolated hosts, and allow trusted app host ancestors for extension iframe documents so agent-native apps can run inside iframe hosts.
- f424018: Reconcile deferred external state updates after local editing becomes inactive so agent changes can appear live without a refresh.
- f424018: Keep streamed assistant text visible across transient chat continuations so tool cards no longer jump ahead of earlier text.

## 0.35.3

### Patch Changes

- 2da75f1: Harden Agent Teams serverless dispatch and visibility: quick non-2xx
  self-dispatch responses now fail the sub-agent instead of leaving a ghost
  running task, and background transcripts/stop controls resolve the active
  chunked run id.
- 2da75f1: Add browser-safe client helpers for reading, writing, setting, and deleting
  application state through the framework transport, plus an imperative
  `callAction` helper for client action calls that do not fit React hooks.
- 2da75f1: Keep hosted template server shells CDN-cacheable by applying the shared SSR SWR
  headers to auth login HTML and always enforcing SSR cache headers on React
  Router shell/data responses.
- 2da75f1: Make the stateless MCP server serverless-safe so remote hosts (Claude Code,
  etc.) can actually complete `tools/call`. Two changes to the Streamable HTTP
  transport: (1) `enableJsonResponse: true` so request/response is returned as
  JSON inside the request lifecycle instead of an SSE event pushed after a
  serverless instance has frozen (which dropped the result and surfaced as
  "session expired"); (2) answer `405` for `GET` so clients don't latch onto a
  standalone server-to-client SSE stream a stateless per-request instance can't keep
  alive ("not connected"). Inline MCP App rendering and direct tool calls now
  work over the hosted connectors.
- 2da75f1: Enhance local context reports with workflow diagnostics and update the built-in
  Plans skill installer metadata.
- 2da75f1: Add observable agent chat context helpers for advanced staged prompt context
  sync while keeping `sendToAgentChat({ message, context, submit })` as the
  primary simple UI handoff API.
- 2da75f1: Harden provider API runtime credential scoping and catalog allowlists from late
  review feedback.
- 2da75f1: Quietly handle local auto-dev-account signup races and expose stable core
  client leaf exports for apps that need to avoid the broad client barrel.
- 2da75f1: Move the agent runs tray out of the agent panel header and into the chat overflow menu.

## 0.35.2

### Patch Changes

- 2dccc2a: Exclude `pnpm-lock.yaml` from CLI scaffolding so a freshly created app does not ship a stale lockfile copied from the source template.

## 0.35.1

### Patch Changes

- 56888a3: Update React Router dependencies to 7.16.0.

## 0.35.0

### Minor Changes

- 4740d41: Add a local Context X-Ray skill installer that writes a turnkey context-xray
  command, Codex/Claude skill instructions, and slash-command prompts for
  visualizing local coding-agent context usage.

  Project-scoped installs now stay in project `.agents` artifacts, Codex session
  analysis honors `--project`, `--open` uses a local HTML file instead of a
  detached server, and Windows installs get a native command launcher.

- 4740d41: Add Context X-Ray for inspecting and managing the agent context window with
  segment manifests, pin/evict/restore actions, durable directives, and a chat
  composer cockpit.

## 0.34.0

### Minor Changes

- 1acd641: Add a shared provider API runtime for flexible, provider-aware authenticated HTTP requests, and expose provider API catalog/docs/request actions from Dispatch.

## 0.33.0

### Minor Changes

- 8509cf0: Add a shared `@agent-native/core/provider-api` module: a reusable provider-API runtime with a credential-resolver hook, SSRF-safe outbound dispatch, a provider catalog (base URLs, auth styles, credential keys, docs/spec URLs, placeholders, examples), and helpers (`createProviderApiRuntime`, `getProviderApiConfig`, `isProviderApiId`, `listProviderApiCatalog`, `listProviderApiIdsForTemplateUse`, `PROVIDER_API_IDS`). Templates can build a thin credential adapter on top instead of hardcoding each provider endpoint.

## 0.32.18

### Patch Changes

- 2876933: Clarify Agent Teams delegation intent and distinguish spawned background tasks from completed work.

## 0.32.17

### Patch Changes

- 966838d: Propagate agent team parent thread metadata through background runs.
- 966838d: Stop a dropped Neon connection from crashing the whole serverless function. `@neondatabase/serverless` mirrors `pg-pool`, which removes its idle `error` listener while a client is checked out — so a WebSocket that drops mid-query (Lambda freeze/thaw, Neon "terminating connection due to administrator command", an idle socket the pooler closed) made the client emit an `error` event with no listener, which Node escalated to an uncaught exception that killed the function. This was the single highest-volume production crash. `attachNeonPoolErrorLogger` now attaches a persistent `error` listener to every client at connect time (covering all three pools — app, per-app, and Better Auth), so a dropped connection degrades to a logged warning and a reconnect on the next query instead of a process crash.

## 0.32.16

### Patch Changes

- c8773be: Fix social preview response handling and harden Agent Teams recovery paths.

## 0.32.15

### Patch Changes

- ba34976: Make repo-root pnpm dev use the lazy framework gateway by default.

## 0.32.14

### Patch Changes

- 6dde14d: Add a keyed agent chat composer context API for staging hidden context before the next prompt is submitted.
- 6dde14d: Agent Teams sub-agents now run reliably on serverless hosts (Netlify/Vercel/AWS Lambda).

  Previously a spawned sub-agent executed as an in-process detached promise from the spawning request. Serverless hosts freeze the function the moment that response flushes, so the sub-agent was suspended mid-run and never completed — yet `spawn` had already returned `status: "running"`, which the orchestrator narrated as "done." Background "batch" jobs reported success but produced no output.

  Sub-agents now use the framework's durable enqueue-to-SQL + self-fire-HTTP pattern (the same one A2A async tasks and integration webhooks use): `spawnTask` enqueues the run and self-fires a fresh, HMAC-signed POST to a new `/_agent-native/agent-teams/_process-run` route, which executes the run in its own function invocation with its own timeout budget. Runs longer than one function's wall-clock checkpoint at the soft-timeout boundary and self-fire a continuation chunk (the server-side analog of the main chat's client-driven continuation), folding into one durable assistant message via a stable turn id. An atomic SQL claim makes duplicate dispatches idempotent.

  Status reporting is now truthful and observable: `status`/`read-result`/`list` reconcile against the durable queue (a single completed chunk at a continuation boundary no longer prematurely marks a multi-chunk task done), dropped dispatches are re-fired, and genuinely-stalled runs fail with a real message instead of hanging as "running." The RunsTray now self-heals an owner's in-flight runs on read, so it reflects precise status without waiting on the orchestrator to poll.

  This path is host-agnostic — it works anywhere Nitro deploys (no `waitUntil` dependency) and falls back to localhost self-dispatch in dev. It requires `APP_URL`/`URL`/`DEPLOY_URL`/`BETTER_AUTH_URL` to be set in production/shared deployments so the deployment can reach its own URL (the same requirement async A2A and webhooks already carry).

  Note: the previous best-effort "sub-agent finished" auto-recap on the parent thread (a second in-process run that also never survived serverless) is removed; the orchestrator is instead prompted to read `status`/`read-result`, and the RunsTray surfaces completion.

- 6dde14d: Improve background agent visibility by surfacing recent runs in the agent panel and tracking Agent Teams launches in the shared progress tray.
- 6dde14d: Dedupe the client export and server fold of the same tool-call turn so it no longer renders twice. Now that rebuilt tool-call ids are scoped by run (`${runId}:tc_1`) while the live client stream uses a bare counter (`tc_1`), the two copies of one turn hashed to different thread-merge fingerprints; the render-only `toolCallId` is now stripped before fingerprinting so they match again.
- 6dde14d: Recover the agent panel after assistant-ui React fiber unmount crashes instead of leaving the chat UI stuck behind the reset panel.
- 6dde14d: Stop the agent chat from giving up on the first soft-timeout when a turn hasn't produced visible output yet. A complex first turn can spend the whole ~40s soft-timeout window "thinking" before any text or tool call, which previously surfaced "The agent stopped before finishing" with zero retries. Silent run timeouts now retry through a larger empty-continuation budget (1 → 3) so transient slow starts recover, while the cap still terminates a genuinely stuck turn with a clear message instead of looping forever.
- 6dde14d: Suppress Node 22 web stream close races from Vite dev socket error handling so `agent-native dev` does not crash during startup.
- 6dde14d: Add generated Agent-Native social preview images and default OG image metadata.
- 6dde14d: Prevent folded continuation turns from persisting duplicate assistant-ui tool-call resource keys, sanitize already-saved duplicates, and recover standalone prompt composers if the duplicate-key crash still appears.

## 0.32.13

### Patch Changes

- 5fe265e: Fix file uploads failing with a misleading "needs file storage" error when Builder.io was connected at org scope. The `/_agent-native/file-upload` route (and its status endpoint) now resolve the active org and include `orgId` in the request context, so org-scoped Builder credentials are found during upload.

## 0.32.12

### Patch Changes

- 9dc6a6f: Tighten generated agent instructions to prefer existing actions over duplicate REST wrappers.

## 0.32.11

### Patch Changes

- 4ee09b9: Copy ffmpeg-static into serverless bundles so Clips media transcription fallback can extract audio in production.

## 0.32.10

### Patch Changes

- 408af9c: Keep the Builder connect popup open by falling back to the signed connect URL already rendered in the UI when the click-time status refresh fails.

## 0.32.9

### Patch Changes

- 221efac: Fix skill installation edge cases and Notion sync refresh behavior.

## 0.32.8

### Patch Changes

- 8a946c6: Use `@theme inline` so scoped CSS variables (e.g. `.dark`, subtree overrides) apply to shadcn/Tailwind color utilities at use time.

## 0.32.7

### Patch Changes

- bacf30d: Expose Builder account plan metadata from the connect flow status.

## 0.32.6

### Patch Changes

- 69a857a: Preserve array values in action GET query parameters across client and server runtimes.
- 69a857a: Respect `submit: false` in `sendToAgentChat()` so agent chat bridge messages prefill the composer instead of submitting immediately.
- 69a857a: Normalize bracketed GET action query parameters through Nitro's getQuery fallback so array schemas receive arrays consistently.
- 69a857a: Persist stale run error diagnostics when reaping interrupted agent runs.
- 69a857a: Keep the embedded CLI scoped to dev-frame surfaces and route desktop template dev apps through the frame so hot reloads do not refresh terminal state.

## 0.32.5

### Patch Changes

- d56f689: Merge runtime route-warmup config overrides with the build-time config, and tune smooth streaming commit cadence.

## 0.32.4

### Patch Changes

- 826fc96: Keep auth fallback HTML out of shared CDN caches and vary docs markdown/html responses by Accept.
- 826fc96: Move safe React Router route data and JS warmup into the core client with configurable Vite defaults.

## 0.32.3

### Patch Changes

- 25d6fd6: Add CDN and Netlify durable cache headers to framework SSR and route data responses.
- 25d6fd6: Smooth streamed assistant text in chat, Agent-Native Code, and the coding CLI.

## 0.32.2

### Patch Changes

- 3d46958: Fix desktop app login failing in dev with a CORS error
  (`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials is not "true"`).

  The desktop app logs in with `credentials: "include"`. In dev its origin
  (`http://localhost:1420`) was matched by the embed-frame Vite middleware, which
  answered the CORS preflight with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` but no
  `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`. The browser then rejected the credentialed
  login. The middleware now also sends `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`
  for origins allowed to use credentials, matching how production responds.

## 0.32.1

### Patch Changes

- d987847: Keep SSR HTML and React Router data responses CDN-cacheable across auth-looking requests, and publish a default no-op Speculation-Rules header to prevent Cloudflare Speed Brain prefetch refusals from surfacing as 503s.

## 0.32.0

### Minor Changes

- a56d93d: Add a shared `@agent-native/core/brand-kit` module — template-agnostic Brand Kit types and brand-signal extraction, plus a single re-export surface over the existing design-token utilities (URL/GitHub/Tailwind/CSS/code/document extraction). This de-duplicates the design-system/brand logic that the `design` and `slides` templates previously copy-pasted, so it can be reused across design, slides, and assets for on-brand generation.

### Patch Changes

- a56d93d: Fix core client runtime races, restricted sharing read checks, and A2A secret
  sync URL safety.
- a56d93d: Fix a batch of verified bugs found in a deep core bug hunt:
  - **Token usage double-counted on `ai-sdk:*` engines.** The AI SDK translator emitted usage from both `finish-step` (per-step) and `finish` (total), so cost tracking, quotas, and context-budget logic saw ~2× the real tokens. Now usage is emitted only from the terminal `finish`.
  - **Cross-tenant screen remounts.** Agent-initiated `refresh-screen` was emitted deployment-global (no owner), so one user's refresh remounted/refetched every other logged-in user's screen. The poll detector is now per-session and owner-scoped, and reads the newest row deterministically (`ORDER BY`/max instead of arbitrary `rows[0]`).
  - **Recoverable soft-timeout turns turned into dead chats.** A transient `thread_data` save failure during a soft-timeout continuation discarded the stashed `auto_continue` and surfaced a hard error; the client now still resumes.
  - **Extension viewer→owner privilege escalation.** A shared/org extension could re-announce its bridge binding from inside the iframe to escalate from viewer to owner. The binding is now latched to the first (pre-user-content) announcement.
  - **LLM-judge evals saw empty transcripts.** The eval transcript builder matched `tool-call`/`tool-result` event types that are never persisted (real shapes are `tool_start`/`tool_done`), stripping all tool activity from judged runs.
  - **MCP static `ACCESS_TOKEN` compared non-constant-time** — now uses `timingSafeEqual`.
  - **Webhook dedup dropped same-second messages** (Telegram/WhatsApp second-resolution timestamps); dedup now prefers the platform's unique message id.
  - **Agent `web-request` and notification webhooks had weaker SSRF protection** than the extension proxy; both now use the shared DNS/redirect/connect-time safe fetch path.
  - **Google Docs reply dedup didn't survive serverless cold starts** (in-memory `Set`), causing duplicate agent replies; processed reply ids are now persisted in the SQL thread mapping.
  - **`upload-image` buffered the entire remote body before enforcing the 25 MB cap** (OOM risk); it now checks `Content-Length` and streams with an early abort.
  - **`useAgentChatGenerating` ignored `tabId`**, so any finished run cleared the generating state of unrelated chat surfaces; it now filters by the run it started.
  - Plus: trace span matching for concurrent same-named tool calls (FIFO), code-mode toggle rollback on server rejection, awareness-map leak prune, retry-delay abort-listener leak, demo-mode status reading the wrong session field, and `removeThread` calling setState inside a state updater.

- a56d93d: Exclude TSX specs and e2e host fixtures from core package builds, refresh the
  package description, and remove unused compatibility/dead streaming code.
- a56d93d: Remove compiler-verified dead code (unused imports, unused non-exported types,
  and side-effect-free unused locals) across the framework. No behavior or public
  API changes — only declarations the TypeScript compiler proves are unreferenced.
- a56d93d: Avoid noisy startup 404s from optimistic chat tabs and make framework route mounting more reliable in serverless builds.
- a56d93d: Route outbound A2A, Dispatch vault, and scheduling webhook requests through
  SSRF-safe URL fetch paths.
- a56d93d: Apply CDN-friendly SWR caching to public SSR HTML and React Router `.data` responses while preserving authenticated/private cache policies, and keep Vite-hashed client assets immutable across deploy targets.

## 0.31.2

### Patch Changes

- 6e6fce7: Internal cleanup sweep: remove unused imports/variables and tidy code (no behavior change).

## 0.31.1

### Patch Changes

- 853ab71: Escape application-state and resource prefix queries so literal `%` and `_` characters do not over-match keys. Also make core store initialization retry after transient failures instead of caching rejected promises, and keep run SSE polling moving past corrupt persisted events.

  Search and rate-limit LIKE filters now treat user text literally, including chat-thread/debug searches and inbound-email sender matching.

## 0.31.0

### Minor Changes

## 0.30.6

### Patch Changes

- 3107f96: Preserve MCP tool error and read-only metadata through action execution, and allow Pinpoint's empty test suite to pass intentionally.

## 0.30.5

### Patch Changes

- 4048de7: Align app-backed skill installs with user-scope requests, keep full JSON install output machine-readable, and let Connect/device-code flows mint standard MCP OAuth tokens with full-catalog coding-agent configs when A2A_SECRET is absent or blank.
- 4048de7: Design exploration now works cleanly from link-only coding agents (Codex, Claude Code CLI, Claude Desktop Code tab): after the user picks a direction in the browser, the editor shows a copyable summary to paste back into chat — matching the Assets picker's standalone handoff. `present-design-variants` now accepts 2–5 directions (3 is the sweet spot) instead of erroring on anything but exactly 3, and its result includes `fallbackInstructions` for the browser path. Docs walk the full install → generate → pick (inline vs link) → apply-to-code flow for both Assets and Design, with the exact paste-back summaries and an install-alias matrix.

## 0.30.4

### Patch Changes

- 2cb6219: CLI + Builder connect: support custom / tunnel origins for local dev.
  - `agent-native skills add` gains a `--mcp-url <url>` flag to register the
    app-backed MCP connector against a custom origin — an ngrok tunnel, a local
    dev server, or a self-hosted deployment — instead of the built-in hosted
    default. A bare origin gets the standard `/_agent-native/mcp` path appended.
  - Fix the "Connect Builder" cli-auth callback when the app is reached via a
    tunnel (e.g. ngrok) whose origin Builder's `/cli-auth` does not trust:
    instead of handing Builder the rejected origin — which makes Builder fall
    back to its own dead `http://localhost:10110/auth` (ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED) —
    fall back to the app's own `http://localhost:<PORT>` in local dev, an origin
    Builder accepts and a same-machine browser can reach. Production origins
    (`*.agent-native.com`) pass the allow-list and are unaffected.

## 0.30.1

### Patch Changes

- 221bb55: Refine the app and code agent prompts toward Anthropic/Claude best practices: convert the extension-vs-Builder routing from a prose if/else tree into a scannable `<routing>` heuristic table, reframe the act-mode handoff and dev-mode capability blocks affirmatively instead of as stacked "do NOT" walls, require the code agent to show verification evidence (the command it ran and its key result) rather than asserting success, and soften the emphasis density in the connect-builder tool description.

## 0.30.0

### Minor Changes

- 8a1ff15: Bring the agent + coding harness toward Codex/Claude-Code parity: gpt-5.5-style behavioral core shared across the app and code agents (persona, engineering judgment, autonomy, verify-before-done, communication/final-answer discipline, parallel tool calls), rewritten sub-agent orchestration guidance, a new core ask-question clarifying-question tool with multiple-choice UI (the client now reads the per-tab application-state key so the question card actually renders), enriched coding tool descriptions, refreshed skills, a new writing-agent-instructions guide + docs page, and analytics workflow-discipline instruction improvements.

## 0.28.4

### Patch Changes

- 6ed5aab: Forward structured MCP app host context so external hosts can use selected assets from embedded apps.

## 0.28.3

### Patch Changes

- f29459d: Clean the temporary auth redirect cache-busting query parameter from browser history after client boot.
- f29459d: Database admin: make the agent's db-admin tools available whenever the DB admin
  itself is (`NODE_ENV === "development"`), instead of only when the agent
  Code-mode toggle is on. This gives true agent/UI parity — the agent can read and
  edit the full database through `db-admin-*` tools in App mode too — and the tool
  descriptions now steer the agent to prefer them over the scoped `db-exec`/
  `db-query` for admin work and for tables without `owner_email`/`org_id` scoping.

## 0.28.2

### Patch Changes

- 19e7008: Clean the temporary auth redirect cache-busting query parameter from browser history after client boot.

## 0.28.1

### Patch Changes

- 704305f: Improve MCP app embedding for external hosts by keeping local embed origins usable, avoiding embed params on dev runtime modules, compacting cached app shells, and acknowledging nested chat handoffs so picked assets can round-trip back to the host.

## 0.28.0

### Minor Changes

- 5000a0b: Rename the agent-capability "dev mode" to "Code mode" for clarity. This is the
  toggle that lets the agent run shell/file/raw-DB tools and edit the app's own
  source code — now named distinctly from environment dev mode (`NODE_ENV` /
  Vite).
  - `useCodeMode()` is now the primary client hook, returning `{ isCodeMode,
canToggle, isLoading, setCodeMode }`.
  - `useDevMode()` is kept as a `@deprecated` alias that returns the old
    `{ isDevMode, canToggle, isLoading, setDevMode }` shape, delegating to the
    same shared internal state so existing callers keep working.
  - Back-compat is fully preserved: the `AGENT_MODE` env var, the
    `/_agent-native/agent-chat/mode` endpoint (its payload still uses `devMode`),
    and the `agent-chat.mode` settings key are unchanged. The `/mode` GET response
    now additively includes a `codeMode` field mirroring `devMode`.

### Patch Changes

- 5000a0b: Keep live agent activity steps pinned above the composer while a chat run is in progress, leaving completed activity trails collapsed in the transcript.

## 0.27.0

- c3852e0: Add a development-mode database admin: visually browse schemas and tables, view/filter/sort/edit data in a spreadsheet-style grid, and run SQL — with full agent/UI parity. Gated to development mode on localhost.

### Patch Changes

- c3852e0: Security hardening for the agent's raw-SQL tools, cross-tenant run isolation,
  server-side SSRF, and CSRF:
  - **db-query / db-exec scope bypass (cross-tenant read/write):** schema-qualified
    schema-qualified table references (`public.<table>` on Postgres) now
    fail with a clear error, since a qualified name bypasses the per-user/per-org
    temporary views that isolate each tenant's rows. The same guard protects the
    extension SQL surface, which routes through the same tools.
  - **Credential exfiltration via db tools:** per-user credential rows
    (`u:<email>:credential:*`, stored by `resolveCredential`) are now excluded from
    the agent's scoped `settings` view, so a prompt-injected agent can no longer
    read the user's own API keys/tokens through `db-query` and send them out.
  - **Cross-tenant agent run leak + abort:** `GET /runs/:id/events`,
    `GET /runs/active`, and `POST /runs/:id/abort` now verify the caller owns the
    run's thread (404 otherwise), closing a hole where any authenticated tenant who
    learned another tenant's runId/threadId could stream their live agent turn
    (assistant text + tool-result payloads) or abort their run.
  - **Server-side SSRF:** the `upload-image` action and the `import-from-url`
    design-token fetcher now route untrusted URLs through a shared `ssrfSafeFetch`
    (DNS-aware private-address check, connect-time IP guard, per-redirect
    re-validation), so they can no longer be steered to cloud metadata, localhost,
    or internal services.
  - **CSRF:** `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-site` is no longer trusted as first-party, so a
    sibling-subdomain page under a shared cookie domain can't ride the session
    cookie for a state-changing request. Legitimate first-party clients still pass
    via the custom-header / JSON paths; iframe and embed flows are unaffected.

- c3852e0: Beta-readiness best-practices audit fixes:
  - **core / sharing:** `mergeCoreSharingActions` now preserves
    `toolCallable`/`publicAgent`/`link`/`mcpApp` (via `preserveActionFlags`),
    restoring the H5 tools-bridge `403` guard on share/unshare/set-visibility that
    was silently dropped during registry merge.
  - **core / HTTP actions:** stop echoing raw `error.message` on uncategorized 500s
    (return a generic message, log detail server-side); validation and explicit
    user-facing errors still pass through.
  - **core / auth:** remove the legacy hardcoded fallback secret literal from the
    production `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` error message. (The `better-auth` security
    version bump is deferred to a dedicated follow-up: `1.6.12` pulls
    `kysely@0.29` which drops exports `better-auth` bundles, breaking the template
    build — it needs a kysely-compatibility fix + an auth smoke-test.)
  - **core / dev:** register `client/transcription/use-live-transcription` in the
    Vite source-alias map so monorepo dev edits resolve from source, not stale
    `dist`.
  - **core:** add `engines.node >=22`; correct the `AuthSession.orgId` doc comment
    (orgs are framework-managed, not the Better Auth organization plugin).
  - **scheduling:** remove the leftover manual `release` script (publishing goes
    through changesets/CI).
  - **shared-app-config:** clarify that the template-catalog `icon` field is an
    internal icon-alias key resolved by the desktop sidebar `ICON_MAP`, not a raw
    `@tabler/icons-react` export name.

- c3852e0: Documentation audit and overhaul. Fixed accuracy bugs across the docs content
  (wrong import paths, stale API shapes/examples, incorrect constants and ports),
  de-duplicated overlapping material (MCP embed bridge, Dispatch resource model,
  data-scoping pipeline, CLI run-model, database/deployment adapter details),
  trimmed and normalized the template docs, expanded the Frames page, added a
  "Using Your Agent" overview, reorganized the docs nav (split Architecture into
  Core Architecture and Data/Auth & Governance, moved Onboarding into Workspace),
  and reconciled terminology.
- c3852e0: Encrypt per-user / per-org credentials at rest. `saveCredential` /
  `resolveCredential` previously stored third-party API keys as plaintext in the
  `settings` table; they now AES-256-GCM-encrypt values using the same key
  material as the secrets vault (`SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` / `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`),
  so a leaked DB backup / pg_dump / read replica no longer exposes plaintext keys.
  Reads transparently fall back to legacy plaintext rows, so nothing breaks during
  rollout. A one-shot, idempotent, non-destructive migration
  (`pnpm action db-migrate-encrypt-credentials`) re-encrypts existing rows in
  place. The encryption helper is now shared between the secrets vault and
  credentials (`secrets/crypto.ts`); behavior of the vault is unchanged.
- c3852e0: Stop inbound email from impersonating real users. The inbound email adapter now
  derives a `senderVerified` flag from the provider's DKIM/SPF
  (`Authentication-Results`) results, and dispatch only grants a sender's real
  identity — their API keys, org secrets, personal instructions, and ownable data
  — when the message is DKIM/SPF-verified for the From domain AND that address is a
  real org member. Unverified or spoofed `From:` headers fall back to a synthetic,
  credential-less owner. Linked identities (`/link`) are unchanged. The legacy
  "trust the From header" behavior can be restored with
  `DISPATCH_TRUST_UNVERIFIED_EMAIL_SENDER=1` (off by default).

## 0.26.9

### Patch Changes

  key with managed image-generation requests.
- a6c58a8: Serve unauthenticated app HTML as cacheable 200 responses and let the sign-in page perform client-side session redirects.
- a6c58a8: Apply the default public SSR cache policy to React Router `.data` responses
  that only carry React Router's default `no-cache` header.
- a6c58a8: Pin Better Auth in scaffolded workspace roots until the latest Kysely adapter build is compatible.

- 119397a: Expose optional MCP server branding metadata from agent chat plugins and let embedded MCP App hosts open Builder connect links.
- 119397a: Allow Cloudflare quick tunnel hostnames in the default Vite dev server host allowlist.

## 0.26.0

### Minor Changes

- a456cf8: Make the agent a real-time peer editor on collaborative documents. Add `isReconcileLeadClient(awareness, clientId)` so exactly one connected client applies an authoritative external snapshot (agent edit, Notion pull, full rewrite) into a shared Y.Doc — the rest receive it through normal Yjs sync — preventing the changed region from being duplicated across clients. Editors now reconcile newer SQL content into the live Y.Doc gated on `updatedAt`, so a lagging poll can never revert live edits and post-refresh content is always correct.

### Patch Changes

- a456cf8: Harden agent chat continuation across serverless timeouts. Fixes several cases where a turn that hit a timeout would error or stall instead of resuming: (1) a tool still in flight when the timeout fires now counts as progress, so the client no longer gives up in ~2s with "connection kept failing" while the server is actively working; (2) the empty-continuation cap is measured by real content (not bare part count) so whitespace-only output can't mask a stall; (3) large tool inputs (create-extension / update-extension HTML) are preserved verbatim in continuation history instead of degrading to a lossy placeholder, so the agent can keep refining; (4) the run-manager terminal/auto_continue event seq is stamped at emit time so late events can't collide and silently drop the continuation signal.
- a456cf8: Use provider-specific agent output-token caps and continue agent runs after max-token stops.
- a456cf8: Surface inactive Builder access-token gateway errors as reconnectable Builder auth failures.
- a456cf8: Add a reconciled client state hook and further compact agent prompt context.
- a456cf8: Reduce default agent token budgets and trim always-on prompt context for routine requests.

## 0.25.0

### Minor Changes

- ed1502b: Add "Upload Skill" option to the resources create menu so users can import an existing SKILL.md file.

## 0.24.10

### Patch Changes

- fb600a2: Harden agent chat continuation across serverless timeouts. Fixes several cases where a turn that hit a timeout would error or stall instead of resuming: (1) a tool still in flight when the timeout fires now counts as progress, so the client no longer gives up in ~2s with "connection kept failing" while the server is actively working; (2) the empty-continuation cap is measured by real content (not bare part count) so whitespace-only output can't mask a stall; (3) large tool inputs (create-extension / update-extension HTML) are preserved verbatim in continuation history instead of degrading to a lossy placeholder, so the agent can keep refining; (4) the run-manager terminal/auto_continue event seq is stamped at emit time so late events can't collide and silently drop the continuation signal.

## 0.24.9

### Patch Changes

- 5ae4924: Cap the per-message `<current-screen>` context so a large `view-screen` snapshot (e.g. a recording/meeting page returning a full transcript + every segment) can no longer overflow the model context window and hard-error the chat with `context_length_exceeded`. The screen snapshot injected into every user message is now bounded to ~24K chars with a note pointing the agent at `view-screen` / data actions for full detail. This fixes brand-new chats failing on the first message and the very high time-to-first-token caused by an oversized ambient context.

## 0.24.8

### Patch Changes

- aa80e15: Clamp hosted run soft timeouts below upstream hard walls and surface Anthropic tool input progress.
- aa80e15: Add shared default social image metadata helpers and SSR injection.
- aa80e15: Update the open source badge copy to mention Agent-Native is 100% free and open source.
- aa80e15: Keep the chat composer scrolled to the caret when inserting Shift+Enter line breaks.
- aa80e15: Recover client API paths from the live workspace mount when a stale app base path points at another workspace app.
- aa80e15: Stop losing agent chat turns that span a serverless timeout. A turn that is cut off mid-stream (the Builder gateway's 45s wall or the function/heartbeat limit) and resumed via auto-continuation now folds every continuation run onto a single durable assistant message keyed by a stable `turnId`, instead of each run persisting only its own events and dropping the earlier text. This fixes the "the agent stopped, then the last paragraphs disappear and it says it's just getting started" failure: the streamed text and completed tool calls are preserved in `thread_data` (monotonic, never-shrinking) so reloads and follow-up turns keep full context. Errored/cut-off runs are also now classified (`error_code`/`error_detail`) and retained longer than completed runs so failure patterns can be analyzed.
- aa80e15: Inject the default Agent-Native social image into SSR HTML when templates do not provide an OG image.
- aa80e15: Harden workspace scaffold test cleanup against transient filesystem races.

## 0.24.0

### Minor Changes

- 9f3a798: Add extension history snapshots, diffs, and restore support.

### Patch Changes

- 9f3a798: Recover agent chat runs that time out while preparing extension action input.
- 9f3a798: Keep chat recovery retries anchored to the original user request and give hosted timeout recovery more room to persist.
- 9f3a798: Preserve generated chat titles when later thread saves update chat metadata.
- 9f3a798: Keep lazy gateway wake pages active until app dev servers return HTTP responses.

## 0.23.0

### Minor Changes

## 0.22.45

### Patch Changes

- 4bed290: Harden collaborative editing against missed updates and concurrent Yjs persistence races.

## 0.22.44

### Patch Changes

- 7ca6c99: Allow UI-submitted agent chat messages to include image data.

## 0.22.43

### Patch Changes

- bcf54ce: Fix race condition in `useChatThreads` that dropped the active general chat when the user navigated into a scoped resource before `GET /threads` resolved. The scope-flip rehydration effect now defers the decision when thread metadata is unknown (instead of falling through and swapping to the scoped storage key), so the visible conversation is preserved until threads load and a real decision can be made.

## 0.22.42

### Patch Changes

- 5f82202: `open_app({app: "<id>"})` now defaults to the app's home page (`/`) when neither `view` nor `path` is given, instead of throwing `requires 'app' and either 'view' or 'path'`. Hosts (ChatGPT / Claude) previously wasted a turn on the model's first-attempt retry whenever it omitted view/path; this lands the embed on `/` first try.
- 5f82202: Re-export `deleteOrHideExtension` and `hideExtensionForCurrentUser` from `@agent-native/core/client/extensions` so templates that wrap the extensions system (e.g. Workbench Custom Tools) don't have to deep-import internals. Also add CLI templates-meta entry for the new hidden `workbench` template.

## 0.22.41

### Patch Changes

- c790686: Fix MCP App embed regression: `create_embed_session` (and any tool with `_meta.ui.visibility: ["app"]`) now surfaces its raw result via `structuredContent` so the embed iframe can read the mint `startUrl`.

  Without this, PR #875's text-side embed-URL purge stripped the embed start URL from the only fallback the iframe had, breaking the "open inline" flow with "This app can be opened, but not embedded from this MCP server." Compliant hosts already honor the `visibility: ["app"]` hint and keep the tool result out of the LLM transcript; the structuredContent path is safe for these tools.

## 0.22.40

### Patch Changes

- 4a8e279: Route MCP App embed open links through the desktop deep-link handler.

## 0.22.39

### Patch Changes

- 1ed3ef8: Clear MCP app host generate loading state after direct host sends and fall back to the wrapper relay when direct sends fail.

## 0.22.38

### Patch Changes

- 9e22f33: Harden MCP host integration against ticket and content leaks. Strip embed-ticket URLs from any tool result text even when the action does not declare `mcpApp.resource`. Filter `embedTargetPath`, `embedExpiresAt`, and `ticket`-like fields from MCP structured content (their legitimate carrier is `_meta["agent-native/embedStart"]`). Stop fabricating an `_meta["agent-native/openLink"]` `webUrl` from a bare view name like `"deck"` when the action returns only an embed-start URL. Remove the now-unused `compose` field from `buildDeepLink` so deep-link URLs cannot inline draft contents. Make `isEmbedMcpChatBridgeActive` keep the in-memory bridge flag once enrolled so sandboxed iframes that deny sessionStorage no longer silently drop chat-bridge mode mid-session.

## 0.22.37

### Patch Changes

- 12d3c0f: Fix MCP app host catalog and embed metadata edge cases.

## 0.22.36

### Patch Changes

- 1c0b51e: Add ShareButton options for template-specific access labels and top-positioned share links.
- 1c0b51e: Fix MCP app host context clearing, compact catalog compatibility, and embed-only open-link metadata.
- 1c0b51e: Keep general chat threads visible when navigating into scoped resources.
- 1c0b51e: Keep MCP App host catalogs compact by default, hide one-time embed tickets from model-visible output, and keep host follow-up prompts separate from hidden context.
- 1c0b51e: Bust cached MCP App shells so hosts load the refreshed embed wrapper.
- 1c0b51e: Improve ShareButton member autocomplete with server-side org-member search, pagination, and keyboard selection.

## 0.22.35

### Patch Changes

- 6f76cbe: Bust cached MCP App shells so hosts load the refreshed embed wrapper.

## 0.22.34

### Patch Changes

- bc9c866: Recover built-in auth marketing copy from hosted app request context.
- bc9c866: Use branded first-party auth pages when the default auth guard serves before a template plugin.
- bc9c866: Fix MCP Apps metadata and extension-page embeds for Claude and ChatGPT hosts.
- bc9c866: Keep default SSR HTML cache headers public even when requests include auth cookies.

## 0.22.33

### Patch Changes

- d0a107e: Default MCP Apps hosts to the compact generic app catalog instead of listing every action-specific UI resource.
- d0a107e: Refuse to auto-bind CLI actions when multiple dev session owners exist.

## 0.22.32

### Patch Changes

- 5c6b741: Emit MCP App widget domain metadata so ChatGPT can render submitted app templates.

## 0.22.27

### Patch Changes

- 5986cd0: Keep MCP Apps resource CSP and permissions on UI resources instead of tool descriptors.
- 5986cd0: Add a reusable interactive starfield background with subtle cursor attraction.

## 0.22.26

### Patch Changes

- 0efeaec: Allow Dispatch-routed MCP app embeds to authenticate target apps with synced org A2A secrets.

## 0.22.25

### Patch Changes

- b76bf4f: Bust MCP App shell resource caches so host CSP metadata refreshes after embed changes.

## 0.22.24

### Patch Changes

- b275383: Allow MCP app embed wrappers to connect to configured frame domains so Claude can transplant cross-app embeds.

## 0.22.23

### Patch Changes

- 75223dd: Fix Dispatch-routed MCP App embed sessions and surface embed helper errors in the wrapper.
- 75223dd: Expose current extension ids to agents and wait for tracked async framework plugins before dispatching first serverless requests.

## 0.22.22

### Patch Changes

- 1a9d1c0: Mint same-app MCP embed sessions during app launches so Claude can render embedded apps without iframe-originated tool calls.

## 0.22.21

### Patch Changes

- 56e5abc: Use Claude single-frame transplant rendering and ChatGPT controlled route frames for MCP App embeds.

## 0.22.20

### Patch Changes

- 7918065: Default Agent-Native SSR page responses to public cache headers with short max-age, week-long stale-while-revalidate, and hour-long stale-if-error, without creating sessions for anonymous page hits.
- 7918065: Improve MCP App route embeds by using signed real app routes across hosts, preserving host chat bridge state, controlling ChatGPT route height, and mounting the real signed app document inside Claude's proxied MCP content frame.
- 7918065: Make MCP app embeds default to 560px, shrink toward the host-visible height, and cap dynamic resize reports at the configured embed height.

## 0.22.19

### Patch Changes

- 1750384: Make MCP App embeds navigate the host frame into the real app route, keep the MCP chat bridge alive after embed-token redirects, and cache-bust the shared MCP App shell resource.

## 0.22.18

### Patch Changes

- bf1cb24: Expose MCP App CSP metadata, compact unknown OAuth app hosts, support ChatGPT's window.openai bridge, and show a Claude-safe fallback when nested app frames are blocked.

## 0.22.17

### Patch Changes

- 5173662: Add COEP-compatible dev headers for MCP embed page loads.
- 5173662: Emit Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy for validated MCP embed-session page loads.

- 5173662: Lower default full-app MCP App embeds to a 720px app viewport.
- 5173662: Allow MCP app embeds to load resources from the request origin.
- 5173662: Prevent same-origin 401/403 responses from causing client retry storms.

## 0.22.16

### Patch Changes

- 6de0eaf: Fix `/assets/*` 404s in production builds. The React Router client build is now
  copied into Nitro's `publicDir` before `nitroBuild` runs, so the static-asset
  manifest baked into the server bundle includes hashed JS/CSS chunks. Previously
  the copy happened after `nitroBuild`, leaving the files on disk but invisible to
  Nitro's runtime `serveStatic` handler — every `/assets/*` request fell through
  to the SSR catch-all, which 404s any path with a file extension.

## 0.22.15

### Patch Changes

- 0ba051e: Relay `sendToAgentChat()` submissions from MCP App embeds to compatible chat hosts.
- 0ba051e: Prevent HEAD probes from consuming one-time MCP app embed tickets before iframe navigation.
- 0ba051e: Add client helpers for MCP App host integration.
- 0ba051e: Add an embedRoute helper that pairs action deep links with MCP App resources.
- 0ba051e: Add a ShareButton hook for hiding organization-link resources from discovery.

## 0.22.14

### Patch Changes

- b09db79: Prevent unavailable optional agent engines from being selected by chat model pickers or explicit runtime overrides.

## 0.22.13

### Patch Changes

- 0b4ade2: Use the official Gemini 3.5 Flash model ID for the Google provider.
- 9482ec9: Harden serverless database pool cleanup and chat thread conflict retries.
- 54f295b: Make MCP App embeds launch real app routes reliably and keep web-host discovery compact.

## 0.22.12

### Patch Changes

- c43d534: Fix MCP App full-app embed launching through open routes and keep app-host discovery compact.

## 0.22.11

### Patch Changes

- e3b219b: Emit compact MCP Apps tool catalogs for OAuth app hosts and include ChatGPT-compatible widget metadata for real app embeds.

## 0.22.10

- ce325de: Include chat session context in feedback submissions and harden chat debug clipboard actions.

## 0.22.9

### Patch Changes

- e834a27: Improve MCP App embed startup reliability.

## 0.22.8

### Patch Changes

- bbaa675: Allow MCP App frame CSP sources emitted by the built-in app embed helper so local and HTTPS app frames render correctly, and expose the helper through the browser-safe core entry used by template actions.
- bbaa675: Clarify MCP app embeds can target focused app routes as well as full app surfaces.
- bbaa675: Request taller full-app MCP App embeds.
- bbaa675: Prevent replayed chat history with interrupted tool calls from sending malformed tool-use messages to model gateways.

## 0.22.7

### Patch Changes

- 2fcecb9: Fix `backfillEngineMessagesToolResults` so a `tool-result` is only paired with `tool-call`s from assistant messages that appeared earlier in the conversation. The previous global lookup overwrote earlier entries when ids collided (e.g. reused `continuation_tc_*` ids after adapter recreation), causing older history to be backfilled with the wrong `tool_name` / `tool_input` and sent that way to the Builder LLM gateway.
- 2fcecb9: Include `tool_name` and `tool_input` on every `tool_result` sent to the Builder LLM gateway (Gemini compatibility), backfill from prior `tool_use` when replaying history, add gateway client identification headers, and require `toolName`/`toolInput` on engine tool-result parts. Preserve unmatched structured-history tool results as text (then run `backfillEngineMessagesToolResults`) so replay never drops that payload before backfill runs. `backfillEngineMessagesToolResults` now turns orphan engine `tool-result` parts into the same replay text (instead of silently dropping them), and structured history coerces legacy non-string `toolCallId` / `content` shapes from stored JSON.

## 0.22.6

### Patch Changes

- 789ba7d: Clarify starter app creation guidance, seed app descriptions, and remove starter/new-app leftovers from starter-derived apps.
- 789ba7d: Add Dispatch unified MCP gateway guidance and app-grant controls.
- 789ba7d: Add MCP App full-app embedding with short-lived browser sessions.
- 789ba7d: Ignore test files when discovering and generating runtime action registries.
- 789ba7d: Skip stored AI SDK agent engines when their optional runtime packages are not installed.

## 0.22.5

### Patch Changes

- 7873242: Clear the chat attachment drop overlay when editor-level drops consume the drop event.
- 7873242: Resolve Builder assistant credentials from a single complete user/org/workspace scope so partial personal rows do not hide org-shared connections.
- 7873242: Start fresh chats on new browser/project surfaces instead of auto-opening the latest server thread.
- 7873242: Sanitize resent email verification callback URLs before forwarding to Better Auth.

## 0.22.4

### Patch Changes

- b5fc3b7: `/_agent-native/mcp/connect` now leads with the no-CLI path: the remote MCP URL is shown with a copy button, and a Claude/ChatGPT/Cursor/Claude Code/Codex/Other tab strip walks users through each host (paste-the-URL for OAuth hosts, one-line `claude mcp add` / `npx @agent-native/core@latest connect` snippets for CLI hosts) so non-developers can connect a chat host without ever opening a terminal. The static-token mint flow and connections list keep their existing endpoints; tests cover the new sections.

## 0.22.3

### Patch Changes

- 5a5b620: Isolate local dev auth cookies per app and stop first-party hosted apps from sharing incompatible agent-native.com session cookies.
- 5a5b620: Derive production workspace auth and OAuth signing secrets from A2A_SECRET when explicit auth secrets are not configured.

## 0.22.2

### Patch Changes

- 4a35c70: Preserve MCP Apps metadata during static action discovery and write hosted Codex MCP installs as HTTP server entries.

## 0.22.1

### Patch Changes

- 570923a: Respect the persisted agent chat sidebar state inside Builder frames.
- 570923a: Persist mutating action change markers so child-process actions refresh custom app UIs.

## 0.22.0

### Minor Changes

- 819cf59: Add standard remote MCP OAuth discovery, authorization-code + PKCE, refresh-token rotation, scoped MCP access tokens, and OAuth-native `agent-native connect` config for Claude Code clients.

### Patch Changes

- 819cf59: Improve custom app action sync defaults and starter guidance.
- 819cf59: Honor collapsed agent-sidebar deep links when an already-mounted app receives the URL hint.
- 819cf59: Mount the local agent sidebar before delivering programmatic chat submissions so prompts are not dropped when the sidebar starts closed.
- 819cf59: Address MCP app route hardening and Dispatch vault cleanup edge cases from review.
- 819cf59: Fix dev-mode agent feedback issues around connection-reset overlays, request-scoped shell identity, and assistant markdown rendering.
- 819cf59: Sign Builder connect URLs rendered in chat cards and return gateway callbacks to the preview opener.
- 819cf59: Add granular extension content edits with marker/section operations and optional Prettier formatting.

## 0.21.0

### Minor Changes

- 65d43fd: Add host-side MCP Apps rendering support for connected MCP tools.

### Patch Changes

- 65d43fd: Add `agent-native connect dev` and `agent-native connect prod` for switching first-party MCP entries between hosted apps and local dev-lazy gateways.
- 65d43fd: Add optional MCP Apps UI resources for action tools while preserving deep-link fallbacks.
- 15d9967: Clean up synced Dispatch vault secrets on delete and make DB timeout cleanup awaitable.

## 0.20.9

### Patch Changes

- 482e9db: Make agent chat recovery continue after useful tool progress instead of prematurely surfacing connection failures.
- 482e9db: Add an interactive hosted-app picker when `agent-native connect` is run without a URL, and default connect-minted MCP tokens to a 365-day lifetime.
- 482e9db: Bound every DB init/query op with a timeout (`withDbTimeout`, `DB_OP_TIMEOUT_MS`, default 8s on serverless). A frozen→thawed serverless instance could leave the Neon WebSocket hung mid-query so the promise never settled and never errored — `retryOnConnectionError` only retries thrown errors, so authenticated requests (which run a session lookup on every navigation) hung until the platform killed the function (~30s on Netlify), surfacing as "the site won't load". The timeout reports as a retryable `CONNECT_TIMEOUT`, so the existing retry and reject-reset paths recover and the cached session-table init promise no longer stays poisoned. Also drop a failed/hung `getDbExec` init promise so the next call retries a fresh connection instead of re-awaiting a permanently rejected/pending one.
- 482e9db: Add SEO-friendly extension URLs with generated name slugs and extension page titles.
- 482e9db: Keep auth endpoints responsive when agent chat startup stalls, and expose framework session cookie helpers for custom auth plugins.

## 0.20.8

## 0.20.2

### Patch Changes

- f343737: Fall back to redirect Google sign-in when the popup OAuth window is blocked.
- f343737: Quiet Builder credential and engine detection diagnostics unless debug tracing is enabled.
- f343737: Prompt for target agent clients during `agent-native connect` and remember the selection.
- f343737: Soften the MCP connect authorization UI and collapse existing connections by default.

## 0.20.1

### Patch Changes

- 6f3002f: Prevent integration retry timers from keeping Netlify function invocations open and retry Postgres connection timeouts.

## 0.20.0

### Minor Changes

- 3eb86c8: Add shared Code chat transcript replay, prompt attachment helpers, and injectable AssistantChat runtime adapters.

### Patch Changes

- 3eb86c8: Allow extensions to resolve vault-backed keys from the active workspace and mirror Dispatch vault saves into the shared credential store.
- 3eb86c8: Respect externally supplied Builder-backed model availability in the shared composer model picker.
- 3eb86c8: Preserve spaces between streamed Agent-Native Code transcript chunks.
- 3eb86c8: Collapse the agent sidebar by default when opening external-agent deep links.
- 3eb86c8: Bound agent chat startup/history size and surface stalled or quota-capped runs instead of retrying forever.

## 0.19.3

### Patch Changes

- 39b4db3: Harden and complete external-agent MCP connect flows for hosted and local apps.
  - A connect-minted token (or `mcp install` / ACCESS_TOKEN / production caller)
    now gets the full MCP tool surface — including mutating template actions
    like `create-document` — even in local dev, matching the documented
    external-agents contract. Previously a connected Claude Code/Codex/Cowork
    only saw framework builtins in dev, so "say it and it does it" didn't work
    against a local app.
  - `list_apps` now reports the live request origin and `running: true` for the
    app serving the request, instead of a guessed `PORT || 5173` URL with
    `running: false` (which mis-pointed cross-app deep links on non-default
    dev ports).
  - The in-app Connect page now auto-refreshes "Your connections" after a
    device authorize, so the new connection appears (with a "Connected"
    confirmation) without a manual reload.

## 0.19.2

### Patch Changes

- 046a8f2: Improve the external-agent connect screen hierarchy and device-code presentation.

## 0.19.1

### Patch Changes

- 310c02f: Add context-aware dynamic prompt suggestions to the agent chat empty state.
- 310c02f: Tighten read-only bash command guards and scope org-directory/A2A routing auth by caller org identity.
- 310c02f: Reduce production Sentry noise from expected transport and authorization errors.
- 310c02f: Share the minimal bash/read/edit/write coding tool profile between Agent-Native Code and sidebar development mode.

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- b3de2db: Cross-app SSO ("Sign in with Agent-Native", Dispatch as identity authority).
  New opt-in env `AGENT_NATIVE_IDENTITY_HUB_URL`: when set, an app exposes
  `/_agent-native/identity/login` + `/callback`, redirects to the hub's
  `/_agent-native/identity/authorize`, verifies the short-lived `A2A_SECRET`-
  signed identity token (strict `scope:"identity"`, single-use CSRF state,
  `iat`/`exp` bounds), and **JIT-links to the local Better Auth user strictly by
  verified email** — existing same-email user is linked (additive `account` row
  via the adapter; the user/session rows are never modified, renamed, or
  deleted), new email is created via the normal signup path — then mints a normal
  local session. Unset = zero behavior change (fully reversible; per-app canary
  via one env var). Identity rows are only ever added to, so rolling this out
  logs users out once and they log back into the _same_ account with data intact.
  Includes the `redirect()` staged-`Set-Cookie`-on-302 fix so the session
  survives the federated callback. The Dispatch-side identity authority lives in
  the (private) dispatch template.
- b3de2db: Frictionless connect for external agents. New `agent-native connect <url>`
  (and `connect --all`) drives an OAuth-style device-code flow: a logged-in
  browser session mints a per-user, scoped, **revocable** MCP token (an
  `A2A_SECRET`-signed JWT with a `jti`) and the CLI writes the HTTP MCP server
  entry for every detected client (Claude Code desktop/CLI, Codex, Cowork) — no
  shared secret copying, no local server. Adds the framework-served
  `/_agent-native/mcp/connect` page + token mint / device-code / list / revoke
  endpoints (mounted by the core routes plugin, gated by `disableMcpConnect`),
  two additive framework tables (`mcp_connect_tokens`, `mcp_device_codes`), a
  `jti` revoke check in the MCP `verifyAuth`, and an optional `extraClaims` on
  `signA2AToken`. Connecting to hosted apps is now the primary documented path;
  local-dev `mcp install` / stdio remains as the advanced path.

### Patch Changes

- b3de2db: Fix local-dev zero-setup auto-sign-in: the session cookie is now emitted on
  the 302 itself. `maybeAutoCreateDevSession` returned a bare
  `new Response("", { status: 302, headers: { Location } })` after staging the
  session cookie via `setFrameworkSessionCookie`. h3 v2's `prepareResponse`
  only merges the event's staged response headers into a returned web
  `Response` when that Response is 2xx — its `!val.ok` early-return hands a
  non-2xx Response (like a 302) back as-is, dropping the staged `Set-Cookie`.
  A fresh `pnpm dev` therefore 302'd straight to the app and bounced back to
  the login form. A new `redirectWithStagedCookies` helper mirrors the staged
  cookies onto the redirect Response's own headers so the 302 actually carries
  the session.

  Also hardens the dev auto-account so the convenience can't become an
  exposure: it now (1) only fires for **loopback** requests — a new shared
  `isLoopbackRequest` helper (also adopted by the desktop-SSO broker) so a
  tunnelled / reverse-proxied / misconfigured-non-prod dev server never
  auto-signs-in a remote visitor; and (2) mints a **random per-DB password**
  printed to the server console once, instead of the source-code-known fixed
  `local-dev-account`, so there is no shared credential to reuse. Still gated
  on `NODE_ENV` and `AGENT_NATIVE_DISABLE_AUTO_DEV_ACCOUNT=1`.

- b3de2db: Remove the "Effective context" card grid from the resources editor and replace the section-title hover tooltips (Workspace / Organization / Personal) with a dedicated small help icon. The inherited Workspace section is now hidden unless workspace context exists.
- b3de2db: Share composer submit intent, transcript normalization, and conversation scroll primitives with Agent-Native Code.

## 0.18.1

### Patch Changes

- 24049a6: External-agent bridge follow-up fixes: add `/_agent-native/mcp` to the auth
  bypass allowlist so the stdio proxy / external MCP clients reach the endpoint's
  own `verifyAuth` (was 401); static `ACCESS_TOKEN` requests now carry caller
  identity via `AGENT_NATIVE_OWNER_EMAIL`/`X-Agent-Native-Owner-Email`; `open_app`
  / `create_workspace_app` use the target app origin and `ask_app` routes
  cross-app over A2A honestly; validate decoded compose `draft.id` in
  `/_agent-native/open`; swallow benign post-flush `ERR_STREAM_WRITE_AFTER_END`;
  fix the local-dev auto-account email (`dev@local` → `dev@local.test`, rejected
  by better-auth 1.6.0) with legacy dual-exclusion.

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- 921715a: Seamless bridge to external coding agents (Claude Code, Cowork, Codex). Actions
  gain an optional `link` builder; MCP tool results now append an "Open in … →"
  deep link (`_meta["agent-native/openLink"]` + markdown). New
  `/_agent-native/open` route bridges those links to the existing
  `navigate`/`application_state` mechanism, scoped to the browser session. Adds
  `buildDeepLink`/`toAbsoluteOpenUrl`/`toDesktopOpenUrl` helpers, an
  `agent-native mcp` CLI (serve/install/uninstall/status/token) with stdio
  transport + one-command install for Claude Code/Codex/Cowork, and generic
  cross-app MCP tools (`list_apps`, `open_app`, `ask_app`, `create_workspace_app`,
  `list_templates`). All additive and backward compatible.

## 0.17.2

### Patch Changes

- 480c078: Cap the Postgres connection pool to a single connection per instance on serverless runtimes (Netlify Functions / AWS Lambda). Concurrent frozen Lambda instances each holding postgres.js's default 10-connection pool were exhausting Neon/Postgres' connection limit, causing "Max client connections reached" and HTTP 500s on every `/_agent-native/*` route. Long-lived Node servers keep the normal pool.

## 0.17.1

### Patch Changes

- 8b0a941: Fix agent sidebar resurrecting an old closed tab on refresh. When all tabs were closed down to a single new empty tab, reloading the page replaced it with the most-recent old conversation because the empty tab is never persisted server-side and the in-memory newly-created marker is wiped by the reload. The saved tab is now restored verbatim as an optimistic empty tab instead of falling back to an unrelated old chat. Stale (>12h) tab clearing is unchanged.
- 8b0a941: Composer toolbar: drop the leading pencil/clipboard icon from the Act/Plan mode picker, and hide the reasoning-level suffix ("· Auto") when the chatfield is narrower than 370px so the model name + version stays fully readable instead of truncating. The reasoning level is still reachable via the model picker popover. Also alias `@agent-native/core/styles/agent-native.css` to source in dev so CSS edits take effect live instead of silently loading the stale built copy.
- 8b0a941: Refine Demo Mode redaction: only coerce a name-key value to a fake name when it's a 2–4 word person name (mail labels/tabs like "Important" no longer mangled); stable mappings via a bounded, TTL'd, leak-free cache plus produced-fake idempotency so names/emails don't drift when a draft is edited and refetched; realistic stand-in email domains instead of example.com; protect SQL/query/expression/code keys so analytics panel queries aren't corrupted by redaction (chart titles/names still faked, queries run intact); fetch interceptor hardened to be a zero-overhead pass-through when demo mode is off and to never touch agent/run/streaming transport. Plus DemoModeSection/action-routes wiring and tightened TiptapComposer, use-chat-threads, and use-db-sync behavior.
- 8b0a941: Fix Google sign-in popup showing "[object Object]" instead of redirecting to Google. The `/_agent-native/google/auth-url?redirect=1` path used h3 v2's `sendRedirect`, which (in `2.0.1-rc.20`) ignores the event and returns a non-standard `HTTPResponse` instance; the request-handler shim stringified it to `[object Object]` with a 200 status and no `Location` header. It now returns a native web `Response` 302, matching the proven OAuth response idiom used by the callback route.

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- a21633b: Add demo mode: a settings toggle / `toggle-demo-mode` agent action / `DEMO_MODE` env that deterministically replaces real names, emails, and numbers with realistic fake data in every action result — for both the UI and what the agent sees. IDs, dates, URLs, and structure are preserved (protect-first tokenization + key denylist) so the app keeps working. The redaction walk is fully gated and only runs when demo mode is on.

## 0.16.3

### Patch Changes

- dbf8db4: Tag Builder connect URLs with Agent-Native signup source and flow attribution.
- dbf8db4: Expose Agent Teams background runs through agent-chat Code hub-compatible run APIs.
- dbf8db4: Deliver queued Agent Teams messages to running sub-agents at safe continuation points.

- dbf8db4: Track last-used audit metadata for reusable workspace connections and grants.
- dbf8db4: Add reusable runtime credential resolution for granted workspace connections.

## 0.16.2

### Patch Changes

- 5b9bdd7: Fix chat dictation: "auto" mode now uses browser-native SpeechRecognition when available, matching the macros-app record-button experience. Words stream incrementally into the composer with no server API key required. Explicit server providers (builder, gemini, groq, openai) are unchanged.

## 0.16.1

### Patch Changes

- 85d6554: Auto-hide sidebar tabs after 12 h of inactivity (previously 4 h, empty-only). Any tab inactive for more than 12 hours is now removed from the sidebar on load and the user is dropped into a fresh tab; older threads remain accessible via History.

## 0.16.0

- 79a0eb9: Add a batteries-included embedded Agent-Native runtime with host-auth server mounting, a React embedded sidebar/surface, and direct browser-session context/action registration.
- 79a0eb9: Add a SQL-backed browser-session bridge so embedded sidecars can register live host tabs, let backend agent tools inspect page context, run client actions, and send host refresh/navigation/remount commands.
- 79a0eb9: Add portable extension iframe and slot primitives for embedding SDK hosts, including manifest-gated permissions and storage adapters.

- 79a0eb9: Expose package-provided actions through template action runners and add a full Dispatch Dreams settings editor.
- 79a0eb9: Add explicit shared composer layout variants and toolbar slot hooks.
- 79a0eb9: Expose Agent-Native Code project commands and skills as structured code-pack metadata.
- 79a0eb9: Build the core package before packing local file dependencies so generated framework workspaces install a fresh dist snapshot.
- 79a0eb9: Link the local Dispatch package during framework-development workspace creation and build Dispatch before local packing.
- 79a0eb9: Inherit Dispatch-managed workspace instructions, skills, and reference resources at runtime; seed and restore starter company, brand, messaging, guardrail, and voice resources; show and inspect each app's effective workspace context stack; gate All-app resource edits through Dispatch approvals when enabled; preview global impact and overrides before save; and expose read-only inherited workspace resources in app panels.
- 79a0eb9: Improve `/migrate` CLI handoff output with clearer Agent-Native Code resume commands and artifact guidance.
- 79a0eb9: Add the generic Agent-Native Code `/migrate` CLI entrypoint, any-input migration seeding, and own-agent dossier emit output for code-agent handoff.
- 79a0eb9: Export a reusable full-page agent chat surface backed by AgentPanel internals.
- 79a0eb9: Expose safe public-agent read-only actions in the unauthenticated agent surface.
- 79a0eb9: Expose shared workspace connection app-access semantics for reusable integrations.
- 79a0eb9: Add SQL-backed remote integration relay device, command, run-event, management, and push-registration endpoints.
- 79a0eb9: Remove legacy workspace-resource sync actions and clarify runtime inheritance docs.
- 79a0eb9: Add runtime inheritance contract coverage for workspace resources.
- 79a0eb9: Require authentication before dry-running arbitrary MCP server URLs.
- 79a0eb9: Add shared workspace connection app-grant and provider-readiness helpers for reusable integrations.
- 79a0eb9: Route Telegram `/code` commands from Dispatch to the remote code-agent relay.
- 79a0eb9: Add a typed workspace connection provider catalog for reusable integration metadata.
- 79a0eb9: Add scoped workspace connection grant storage and helpers for connect-once, grant-to-app integrations.

## 0.15.8

### Patch Changes

- 3084676: Handle Builder cli-auth callback fallback for preview hosts not in Builder's allow-list, surface rejected credentials on status / Settings, scope callback postMessage to the parent origin, and self-heal credential auth-failure markers after a successful gateway call.

- 10dc17f: Keep the pre-hydration theme script's resolved data-theme in sync with the html class.

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- f400c81: Two additions to core:
  - **`AppearancePicker` + `change-appearance` action.** New per-user appearance presets (`warm` / `ocean` / `forest` / `rose` / `slate` + the default) that override the base HSL theme tokens. The runtime reads `localStorage["appearance"]` in the inline theme-init script and sets `<html data-appearance="...">` before hydration, so there's no first-paint flash. Exports: `APPEARANCE_PRESETS`, `applyAppearance`, `getStoredAppearance`, `useAppearance`, `AppearanceSync`, `AppearancePicker`. The agent can change the active preset via the new `change-appearance` core sharing action — auto-registered through `mergeCoreSharingActions`, so every template inherits it.
  - **`guard-extension-no-public.mjs`.** New CI guard wired into `pnpm guards`. Statically refuses any change that drops `allowPublic: false` / `requireOrgMemberForUserShares: true` from the extension shareable registration, or that introduces a string literal / raw SQL flipping an extension row to `visibility = "public"` outside the framework-level `set-resource-visibility` action. `sharing` skill updated to document the two new registration flags and point at the guard.

- b5b6f22: New optional `emptyStateAddon` prop on `AssistantChat` — content rendered in the empty state above the suggestion buttons. Used by `MultiTabAssistantChat` to surface "previous chats for this design" when the current thread is empty but the scope has other threads. No behaviour change when the prop isn't passed.
- 2eb5064: `PromptComposer` + `TiptapComposer`: inline image attachments, attachment-only composer-mode sends, and active-voice cancellation on submit. Image files attached to the composer are now sent inline as `<uploaded-image name=… contentType=…>` data-URL blocks alongside the existing pasted-text / inline-text flattening. Composer modes (`/code`, `/research`, etc.) now also accept submissions with no text when attachments are present — the default prompt becomes "Use the attached context." and the attachments survive the wrap in the mode's prefix + `<context>` block. Every send / build intercept path also cancels any in-flight voice dictation so a late transcript can't land on top of the just-sent message.
- 97ca0db: Export `useBuilderStatus` and `useBuilderConnectFlow` (plus `BuilderConnectFlow` / `BuilderConnectFlowOptions` types) from `@agent-native/core/client`. Both hooks already powered the in-framework SettingsPanel's Builder.io connect flow; surfacing them lets templates reuse the same status read + connect-flow state machine in their own settings UIs without duplicating the SSE / popup-handshake plumbing.
- f400c81: Polish + appearance presets:
  - Sign-in page: add a favicon `<link>` to the onboarding sign-in and reset-password HTML so tabs no longer show the default globe.
  - Sign-in page: suppress the on-screen Google OAuth status overlay ("OAuth exchange redeemed; returning to the app (flow …)" and friends) for end users. Diagnostics still log to the browser console; the overlay can be opted back in with `#oauth-debug` or `?oauth_debug=1` for debugging.
  - Feedback popover: placeholder now leads with concrete examples ("e.g. 'The Send button isn't obvious'…") so users have a clearer prompt than "Tell us what's on your mind…".
  - **New: Appearance presets.** Users can pick a color theme without editing source. Adds a `change-appearance` action (auto-mounted everywhere) that the agent can invoke as a tool, a `<AppearancePicker />` React component for Settings pages, a `useAppearance` / `useAppearanceSync` hook pair, and CSS preset overrides (`warm`, `ocean`, `forest`, `rose`, `slate`) layered on top of each template's base palette via `<html data-appearance="…">`. The theme init script now also applies the stored preset on first paint to avoid FOUC.
  - Agent system prompt now includes a short first-session personalization flow: greet, ask two yes/no questions (theme preset via `change-appearance` plus one template-specific preference), then mark `application_state.personalization = { done: true }` so it never re-asks.

- d1a90ac: Image uploads and drag-and-drop, framework-wide.
  - New `upload-image` agent action — converts a base64 data URL or remote URL into a hosted CDN URL via the active file-upload provider (Builder.io by default, or any provider registered with `registerFileUploadProvider` — S3, R2, GCS, etc.). Auto-registered for every template alongside the sharing actions; the agent now has an explicit tool to materialize chat-attached or generated images as stable URLs for slides, documents, and outbound messages.
  - File-upload registry now uses a `globalThis`-backed singleton. The previous module-level `Map` could be evaluated more than once in some Vite/Nitro bundle-split scenarios — the plugin that called `registerFileUploadProvider()` lived in one module instance and the request handler / server-side pre-upload lived in another, so the call site saw an empty map even though registration succeeded. Custom providers (S3/R2/GCS) and the dev-mode upload path now both see the same map regardless of how the bundler chunked them; Builder.io was unaffected because it has an env-var fallback in `uploadFile()`.
  - Server-side pre-upload of chat image attachments: when a user attaches an image to the agent composer, the framework now uploads it through `uploadFile()` before the model runs and injects a `<chat-image-attachment url="..." />` block at the bottom of the user message. The model still receives the image as multimodal vision content; it just also has the hosted URL to embed in HTML. If no provider is configured, the framework injects a `<chat-image-attachment-upload-error>` block instructing the agent to suggest connecting one.
  - Chat-wide drag-and-drop: the agent sidebar now accepts file drops anywhere on the chat surface (thread, header, composer), not just inside the contenteditable. A "Drop to attach" affordance highlights the chat while files are being dragged over it.
  - Slides drag-and-drop fixes: `/api/assets/upload` now routes uploads strictly through the framework `uploadFile()` provider chain. The previous local-disk path that wrote into `public/uploads/` is gone — it didn't persist on serverless deploys and polluted the source tree on dev runs. With no provider configured, the endpoint returns a clear 503 telling the caller to connect Builder.io (or any registered provider). `listAssets` / `deleteAsset` no longer scan local disk; listing is a no-op for now (until a SQL-backed asset index lands), and deletes go through the provider's own API. Drops anywhere on the slides editor — including the chrome and sidebars — are caught instead of letting the browser navigate to the file; drops outside a placeholder/`<img>` open a popover that hands the image off to the agent chat for the user to describe what to do with it.

- f400c81: Two related additions to the realtime + agent layer:
  - **Per-source change-version primitive.** New `useChangeVersion(source)` / `useChangeVersions(sources)` / `getChangeVersion` / `bumpChangeVersion` exported from `@agent-native/core/client`. Every `recordChange` event carries a `source` and `version`; `useDbSync` now bumps a per-source counter on each event and templates fold the counter into their React Query `queryKey`, so a change to `"dashboards"` only refetches dashboard queries instead of triggering a blanket cache invalidate across the app. Framework-level keys (`action`, `extension`, `application-state`, …) keep their universal invalidate; template data keys (`data`, `dashboards`, `analyses`, `dashboard-views`) no longer do — they react through the per-source counter. Analytics templates updated as the first consumer (CommandPalette / Sidebar / sql-dashboard / AnalysesList).
  - **Scoped chat tabs in `AgentPanel` / `MultiTabAssistantChat`.** New optional `scope?: ChatThreadScope | null` prop on `AgentPanel`. When set, the tab bar partitions per `(storageKey, scope)` so each deck / dashboard / record shows its own thread list, new chats inherit the scope server-side, and the panel renders a "Working on {label}" badge with a Detach button to escape back to the unscoped tab list. Pairs with the server-side `scope_type` / `scope_id` / `scope_label` columns + `setThreadScope` already in `chat-threads/store.ts`.

- ffd3d00: Add first-class workspace app audience metadata with route-level public/protected page access.
- d1a90ac: `ShareButton` now accepts an optional `shareUrlPlaceholder` prop. When the primary `shareUrl` is undefined the popover shows the placeholder inside a subtle dashed-border slot instead of hiding the link section silently. Use it to tell respondents _why_ there's no link yet (e.g. "Publish this form to get a public response link") so the popover doesn't look broken on draft / unpublished resources.
- 5f59f44: Browser tracking now sends a persistent `anonymousId` (visitor ID) and a `sessionId` with a 30-minute idle timeout on every event posted to the Agent-Native Analytics `/track` endpoint. Both IDs are stored in `localStorage` and degrade gracefully to NULL when storage is unavailable (private browsing). Unique-visitor and session metrics in the analytics template now have real data to aggregate against; previously these columns were always NULL for anonymous traffic.
- c6defe7: Real-time sync, take 2: per-source change counters.

  The previous attempt — invalidating every active React Query on any non-own change event — caused a request storm on the analytics dashboard (461 pending requests, polls timing out at the 10s abort). This change replaces it with a targeted, default-on mechanism:
  - New `useChangeVersion(source)` and `useChangeVersions(sources)` hooks return an integer that advances every time the server emits an event with that source (`"dashboards"`, `"analyses"`, `"action"`, `"settings"`, `"app-state"`, etc.). `useDbSync` keeps a per-source counter and bumps it from every poll/SSE event it sees.
  - Templates fold the counter into the relevant React Query `queryKey`. When the source advances, the queryKey changes and React Query refetches that one query — no whole-cache invalidate, no fanned-out refetches across unrelated panels. `placeholderData: (prev) => prev` keeps the old data on screen during the refetch so there's no flicker.
  - `useDbSync` reverts to invalidating a small fixed list of framework-internal prefixes (`["action"]`, `["app-state"]`, `["__set_url__"]`, etc.) and no longer touches templates' own data queries. The legacy `queryKeys` option remains in the type signature for backward compatibility but is ignored.
  - Analytics' dashboard / analysis / sidebar / command-palette queries are wired up. Other templates can adopt the same pattern by importing `useChangeVersion` and including it in their query keys; recommended sources include `"dashboards"`, `"analyses"`, `"settings"`, and `"action"` (the agent runner emits `source: "action"` after every successful mutating tool call, so depending on it catches any agent-driven change to the underlying data).

- 5f59f44: New `usePinchZoom` hook exported from `@agent-native/core/client` for canvas-style editors. Wires trackpad pinch (synthesized as `wheel` events with `ctrlKey: true`) and 2-pointer touchscreen pinch onto a scrolling container, with cursor-anchored zoom-to-cursor support and configurable `min` / `max` percentages. The slides template adopts it on the deck-editor canvas; any template with a zoomable surface can drop it in by attaching the returned ref to the scroll container.

### Patch Changes

- d1a90ac: Agent chat: when the user sends a new message after scrolling up to read history, scroll back to the bottom so the new message and reply land in view. Previously the sticky-bottom override (which exists to stop streaming from yanking the viewport) also swallowed direct sends, leaving the user stuck in old history.
- ffd3d00: Emit agent sidebar open-state events so custom toolbar buttons can track when the chat panel opens or closes itself.
- d1a90ac: Local-dev convenience: skip the sign-up wall on a freshly-scaffolded app. When `NODE_ENV=development` and the `user` table has no rows for any email other than `dev@local`, the auth guard transparently signs up + signs in an auto-managed `dev@local` account on the first page GET and 302s back to the original URL with the session cookie set. A developer who just ran `pnpm dev` lands in the app immediately instead of being asked to fill in name + email + password to try the framework. Once a real user signs up via the regular form, the email-filter short-circuit fires and this helper returns null on every subsequent request, so the normal login flow takes over. Set `AGENT_NATIVE_DISABLE_AUTO_DEV_ACCOUNT=1` to opt out.
- 5f59f44: Docs only: spell out the auto-refresh contract in the default-template and starter `AGENTS.md` so newly-scaffolded apps know that agent writes must reflect in the UI without a manual refresh. Use `useActionQuery` (auto-covered) or fold `useChangeVersions([<source>, "action"])` into raw `useQuery` keys. Mirror the framework `adding-a-feature` and `real-time-sync` skills into `packages/core/src/templates/default/.agents/skills/` and `templates/starter/.agents/skills/` so scaffolded apps inherit the same guidance.
- d1a90ac: Builder credential resolution: implicit-org fallback + trace logging.
  - `agent-chat-plugin`: when `session.orgId` is null (Better Auth leaves it null until the user explicitly switches orgs), fall back to `getOrgContext()` to pick up implicit org membership. A fresh signup with a domain-matched org now sees its org-scoped Builder credentials instead of looking unconnected.
  - `resolveSecret`: log every Builder credential lookup (`[resolve-secret]` lines covering hit/miss + scope + email + orgId). "I connected Builder but chat says no LLM" reports can now be diagnosed from server logs without rerunning the request. Other keys are gated behind `DEBUG_CREDENTIAL_RESOLVE=1` to keep noise low.
  - `core-routes-plugin` builder-connect: log the resolved write scope so we can see which scope (user/org/workspace) a connect actually persisted to.

- d1a90ac: Add inline "Start new chat" button to no-detail Builder gateway error messages. When the gateway returns `{type:"stop",reason:"error",requestId:...}` with no diagnostic, the error UI now renders a one-click CTA next to the message instead of just telling the user to start a new chat manually. The button dispatches an `agent-chat:new-chat` window event that `MultiTabAssistantChat` listens for, matching the existing close-tab event pattern.
- a89082e: Builder reconnect now clears stale credentials before writing the new connection, so reconnecting with a different Builder space actually takes effect.

  `writeBuilderCredentials` previously upserted each new key but left stale rows in place. Two failure modes:
  - Reconnecting with a Builder space that doesn't carry every optional field (e.g. no `orgName`/`orgKind`/`userId`) left the previous connection's metadata behind at the target scope, so the gateway saw a mix of new and old credentials.
  - When a user's first connect wrote at user scope (member or no-org) and a later reconnect wrote at org scope (now owner/admin), the old user-scope row still won resolution — user scope beats org scope by design — so the chat kept using the old Builder space's credentials even though the UI showed the new connection.

  Fix: before writing, delete all five `BUILDER_*` keys at the target scope, and when writing at org scope also delete the writer's user-scope rows. The org-scope row is intentionally left alone when writing at user scope so a single user's personal override doesn't blow away the team's shared connection.

  Reported as "I signed in again with my Builder space not my own one and still telling me I need to upgrade" on 2026-05-11.

- d1a90ac: `builderFileUploadProvider`: retry transient 5xx once with backoff (600ms then 1.8s).

  Builder.io's upload service occasionally returns a bodyless 500 ("Internal Error") on the first attempt — usually GCS write hiccups that succeed on retry. Three template surfaces that hit this on every recording / upload (Clips finalize, attachment uploads, generated-image uploads) now get those transient failures absorbed silently. Deterministic 500s still surface to the caller after the third attempt with the original status + body.

- ad4f135: Keep the in-app agent panel active inside Builder web previews instead of treating them as local dev frames.
- ffd3d00: Recover the agent panel automatically when assistant-ui renders a stale list index.
- ffd3d00: Clarify scoped chat context copy in the assistant sidebar.
- 64792af: Clarify Builder Cloud Agent waitlist guidance so agents do not send users to nonexistent org settings.
- d1a90ac: CLI + dispatch shell fixes from create-workflow feedback:
  - `create`: scaffold `packages/pinpoint` when the user selects `slides` or
    `videos`. Their `package.json` declares `@agent-native/pinpoint:
workspace:*`, but the templates-meta entries were missing
    `requiredPackages: ["pinpoint"]`, so `pnpm install` blew up with
    `ERR_PNPM_WORKSPACE_PKG_NOT_FOUND`. The existing e2e test now covers
    every template with `@agent-native/*` workspace deps so a regression
    surfaces in CI instead of on the user's machine.
  - `create`: per-template progress messages during scaffolding
    (`Scaffolding Slides (3/4)...`, `Adding shared packages...`) and a
    concrete "this is done" stop message, replacing the single static
    "Working... no action needed" line that made a multi-app workspace
    feel hung.
  - `create`: detect `pnpm` on PATH before printing the outro. If it's
    missing, the next-steps block now leads with `npm install -g pnpm`
    instead of dumping the user at `zsh: command not found: pnpm`.
  - `create`: Dispatch is now always scaffolded into a new workspace
    rather than being a recommended-but-optional pick. The picker only
    lists the optional apps; the workspace note explains that Dispatch is
    always included as the control plane. `--template=forms` (or any
    non-Dispatch list) still works — Dispatch gets unioned in. New
    regression test asserts this.
  - Auth guard: local-dev convenience for `NODE_ENV=development`. When
    the `user` table has no real users yet, the first unauthenticated
    page GET transparently signs up (and signs in) a `dev@local` account
    and 302s back to the requested URL, instead of showing the sign-up
    form. A developer running `pnpm dev` lands straight in the app. Once
    any real account exists the auto-create short-circuit fires and the
    regular login flow takes over. Opt out with
    `AGENT_NATIVE_DISABLE_AUTO_DEV_ACCOUNT=1`. Production is unaffected.
  - `DispatchShell`: page-title info icon is now a click-driven Popover
    instead of a hover-only Tooltip, and the trigger button has a
    proper hover background so it reads as clickable. Clicking the icon
    (the natural gesture, and the only available one on touch) did
    nothing before.
  - `create`: clean up the partially-scaffolded directory when scaffolding
    fails (e.g. flaky network during the template download). Without this
    the first failure left the workspace dir on disk, and the next
    `agent-native create <name>` rejected the same name with "Directory
    already exists" — forcing a manual `rm -rf` before retrying.
  - Dispatch apps list: filter dotfile directories (e.g.
    `.agent-native-tmp-*` extraction sidecars) when reading the
    workspace's `apps/` directory. The temp dir is a sibling of the
    target so it appeared at the top of the apps grid mid-scaffold,
    looking like a stray entry.
  - Dispatch onboarding: register a "Create your first app" step at order
    5 so it sits above the Slack/Telegram secret-onboarding steps. A
    brand-new workspace was leading with "Connect Slack" before the user
    had even added an app, which felt confusing.
  - Agent system prompt (chat-in-browser-on-localdev): when a user asks to
    scaffold a new workspace app from a localhost browser tab, point them
    at \`npx @agent-native/core@latest add-app\` first since they're already in
    that terminal. The desktop / Claude Code / Codex / Builder.io
    alternatives still follow for general source-editing work.

- ffd3d00: Add Cmd/Ctrl+Backslash as a global shortcut for toggling the agent sidebar.
- 04c3ed9: Coach users through stalled agent tasks with clearer troubleshooting and next-step guidance.
- b5b6f22: `TiptapComposer`: when a caller passes a custom `actionButton`, render only the model selector + plan-mode toggle on the left side (skipping the voice/file/send cluster that the default action-button slot owns). Without this, callers that already render their own send button got a duplicate-looking trailing block. No behavior change when `actionButton` isn't passed.
- 2eb5064: `AssistantChat`: hide the empty user-message bubble when the text content is nothing but an injected `<context>...</context>` block. Previously, sending an attachment-only composer-mode message (e.g. `/code` with a file but no prose) rendered an empty grey bubble in the chat after the context tags were stripped. The message now skips the bubble + expand/collapse UI entirely when the only attachment is context; attachment chips still render above.
- 2eb5064: `useDbSync` + server poll: per-key invalidation for application_state one-shot commands. The poll loop now emits one event per changed (key, owner) pair instead of a single `key: "*"` wildcard, and the client only invalidates `navigate-command` / `show-questions` / `__set_url__` queries when those specific keys actually change. Noisy app-state keys (template-specific UI state, per-tab flags) no longer wake the navigation / question readers on every poll cycle.
- 2eb5064: `useVoiceDictation`: cancelling while the transcription request is in flight now actually drops the response. Previously `cancel()` returned early for any state other than `recording` / `starting`, so once the network POST started, a cancel click was a no-op and the transcribed text would still be inserted into the composer after the user cancelled. The fetch handlers (both success and live-snapshot fallback) now check `cancelledRef` immediately after the await and bail without forwarding.
- 64792af: Keep Builder connect popups from replacing the Agent-Native desktop webview.
- ddcc773: Raise shadcn floating-UI primitives (Dialog, AlertDialog, Sheet, Drawer, Popover, DropdownMenu, Tooltip, HoverCard, ContextMenu, Menubar, Select) from `z-50` to `z-[250]` so modal overlays cover the agent sidebar header (`z-[240]`). Fixes the case where the "Add Calendar" (and similar) modal opens but the agent chat panel underneath stays visible and interactive.
- f400c81: Add `create-pylon-ticket` action to Dispatch for escalating blockers, unmatched `#customer-*` routing, or follow-ups that need tracking — uses `PYLON_API_KEY` from the Vault. Instrument the agent chat with Sentry captures when the auth-error card stays visible past auto-recovery (`auth_error_card_stuck`) and when SSE reconnect times out (`reconnect_no_progress`) so we can chase the "occasional Reload UI required" symptom.
- b7e7d17: Route the Dispatch thread debugger through workspace root aliases.
- 04c3ed9: `workspaceAppRouteAccessFromPackageJson` now returns optional `publicPaths` / `protectedPaths` so consumers can distinguish "field absent" from "field explicitly empty." `workspace-deploy`, `workspace-dev`, and `agent-discovery` prefer the package.json value whenever it was set (even `[]`), so an app owner can clear an inherited manifest override by writing `"publicPaths": []` in its `package.json`.
- f400c81: Restrict extensions to private/org sharing only — extensions execute code in
  the viewer's authentication context, so they must never be `visibility: "public"`
  and user shares must target someone already in (or invited to) the org.
  - Added `allowPublic` and `requireOrgMemberForUserShares` flags to
    `registerShareableResource()`. Defaults match prior behavior; extensions
    opt into both.
  - `set-resource-visibility` rejects `"public"` for any resource registered
    with `allowPublic: false`. `accessFilter` and `resolveAccess` treat any
    stored `'public'` row as private for those resources (defense in depth).
  - `share-resource` verifies the principal email against `org_members` and
    pending `org_invitations` when `requireOrgMemberForUserShares: true`. The
    same flag also pins `principalType: "org"` shares to the resource's own
    org — cross-org org-principal shares would otherwise let an outside org's
    members run extension code in the viewer's auth context (same threat
    model as a public extension).
  - `updateExtension` and the extension `PUT` route refuse `visibility: "public"`
    directly. `list-resource-shares` returns a `policy` block so the share
    popover hides the "Public" option and shows server errors inline.
  - New `scripts/guard-extension-no-public.mjs` (wired into `pnpm guards` /
    `pnpm prep`) statically enforces that the extension registration keeps
    both flags set, and refuses `visibility: "public"` literals inside
    `packages/core/src/extensions/`.

- d1a90ac: Fixes for feedback from QA pass:
  - **Content** (`templates/content`): deleting the page you're currently viewing now navigates to the landing page **before** the delete round-trip resolves, so the editor doesn't sit on a now-deleted page while the request is in flight. The page-id route also redirects to `/` when the document fetch returns 404, so refreshing on a stale URL no longer dead-ends at "Document not found".
  - **Design** (`templates/design`): clicking the Edit tab no longer auto-collapses the agent chat. Previously, entering edit mode dispatched `agent-panel:close` so the EditPanel and canvas could share the screen, but the chat dropping out shifted the toolbar and removed the user's working context. Properties and chat now coexist as adjacent right-side panels.
  - **OrgSwitcher** (`packages/core`): clicking "Create organization" or "Invite member" now clears any leftover input from a previous session before entering that mode. Previously, the create form could re-open prefilled with the just-created org's name, making the switcher look like a create dialog for the new org.

- d1a90ac: Several feedback fixes:
  - **Dispatch back-button to `/dispatch/dispatch/overview`.** `dispatchNavLinkTarget` (the helper that decides whether NavLink should manually prepend the workspace mount prefix) read `window.__reactRouterContext.basename` to detect the router's basename. If that global wasn't set yet at render time, the helper double-prefixed the `to` prop, the router then prepended its own basename, and the resulting `/dispatch/dispatch/<route>` landed in browser history — clicking back from any dispatch page later took the user to that 404. The helper now mirrors `entry.client.tsx`'s basename calculation directly from `window.location.pathname`, removing the context-global race. `routerPath` (in both the package and the template copy) also iteratively strips the basename so any doubly-prefixed path that snuck into `application_state.navigate` doesn't get partially-stripped here and re-prefixed by the router back to the bad URL.
  - **"Use Builder" CTA stuck after connect (web).** The Builder upsell CTA in `AgentPanel` opens Builder in a `<a target="_blank">` tab, not a popup, so it never started the `useBuilderConnectFlow` polling loop — `useBuilderConnectUrl` was fetched once on mount and never refreshed, leaving the CTA in the "Use Builder" state after the user came back to the original tab. The callback success HTML now posts a `builder-connect-success` BroadcastChannel + window.opener message (mirroring the existing error-path broadcast), and `useBuilderConnectUrl` listens on BroadcastChannel + `window.message` + `focus` + `visibilitychange` + the existing `agent-engine:configured-changed` event, refetching `/builder/status` on any of them. Also dispatches `agent-engine:configured-changed` when status first reports configured so the rest of the chat tree updates without a full reload.
  - **Firebase `auth/popup-blocked` in desktop Builder connect.** Builder's `/cli-auth` page signs into Google via `signInWithPopup`, which calls `window.open()`. Inside the Electron OAuth `BrowserWindow` we create for the Builder flow, there was no `setWindowOpenHandler`, so Electron's default silently blocked the popup — Firebase reported `auth/popup-blocked`, the parent OAuth window never received the result, and the user saw a blank screen that then closed. The OAuth window now returns `action: "allow"` for https child popups and constructs the child as another `BrowserWindow` sharing the same `session` so Firebase's `window.opener.postMessage` handshake reaches back.
  - **`resolveScopedBuilderCredential` tracing.** The Builder credential lookup walked user → org → workspace silently; when "I connected Builder but chat says use Builder" reports come in, there was no way to tell which scope answered or whether none did. Each branch now logs the scope, email, orgId, and hit/miss outcome (matching the existing always-on tracing in `resolveSecret` for BUILDER\_\* keys).

- ffd3d00: `forkThread` now overlays the in-memory snapshot on top of the persisted row when the snapshot is fresher (more messages) than what's in SQL. Previously, once any version of the source row existed in the database, the snapshot was ignored — so forks could lose the latest unflushed user message, which is exactly the scenario chat-fork-from-unflushed is meant to fix. Guarded with `snapshot.messageCount > stored.messageCount` so a stale snapshot from another tab can't clobber a fresher persisted row.
- ffd3d00: `AgentPanel` no longer emits a synthetic `{ open: false }` sidebar-state event on mount when the parent frame owns the sidebar. The dispatch is now deferred until the frame sends its first `agentNative.sidebarMode` message, so listeners initialize with the real state instead of seeing a false → true flip a moment later.
- 64792af: Avoid double-submitting Builder chat prompts from embedded app composers by using a single iframe transport when a parent frame is available.
- 9c991e1: Keep Builder preview Google sign-in from returning to loopback preview URLs.
- ce9e355: Open primary Google sign-in from Agent-Native Desktop through the desktop exchange flow so OAuth can complete in the system browser.
- ce9e355: Add LLM connection context to tracking events and track Builder connect clicks.
- 97ca0db: Export `useBuilderStatus` and `useBuilderConnectFlow` from `@agent-native/core/client` so template settings pages can render a connect-builder button that polls for completion instead of a bare `<a target="_blank">` link.
- 1fd5856: Allow owners to manage legacy unscoped shared resources after joining an organization.
- d1a90ac: Org polish:
  - `InvitationBanner`: while a join-by-domain or accept-invitation request is in flight, render an in-place "Joining {orgName}…" status so the chat panel doesn't look unchanged until the view abruptly swaps.
  - `OrgSwitcher`: `settingsPath` is now optional. When unset, "Workspace settings" only opens the in-sidebar settings panel — suitable for templates without a dedicated team page. Templates that mount one (e.g. Dispatch's `/team`) pass it explicitly.
  - `useOrgMembers` / `useOrgInvitations`: scope the React Query cache by active `orgId` so switching/creating an org forces a fresh fetch instead of briefly showing the previous org's members.
  - `useCreateOrg`: invalidate all queries on success (creating an org switches into it server-side, so every org-scoped query is stale), matching `useSwitchOrg`.
  - Create/invite forms: loader uses flex centering so the spinner stays vertically centred inside the button; close the create-org dialog via the unified `handleOpenChange` so cleanup runs.

- ce9e355: Add app navigation links to the organization switcher, with Dispatch pinned as the workspace hub.
- ffd3d00: Standardize the organization switcher settings link around template team pages.
- ad4f135: Use polling file watchers for workspace dev in managed remote containers to avoid Linux inotify limits.
- 64792af: Recover auth sessions when stale duplicate cookies shadow a fresh sign-in.
- b7e7d17: Hide agent-created scratch resources from workspace file lists by default.
- 64792af: Recover the agent chat message list when assistant-ui briefly renders a stale message index.
- ad4f135: Seed shadcn-aware frontend design skills in generated apps and workspaces.
- 13284b1: ErrorBoundary: "Go home" now triggers a full page reload (was client-side
  `<Link>`), so a signed-out visitor who lands on an error page is taken
  through the server auth guard's sign-in flow instead of getting stuck on
  a logged-in route with failing API calls. Also softens the 404 message
  to a plain "We couldn't find this page." for end users — the previous
  copy mentioned Dispatch and "shipping" routes, which only made sense to
  developers working on workspace apps.
- ffd3d00: Make chat forking work when the source thread has not flushed to SQL yet.
- ffd3d00: Redirect mounted Dispatch workspace roots to the overview page across workspace deploy presets.
- 04c3ed9: Surface workspace app startup timeouts instead of looping forever on the gateway wake screen.
- ce9e355: Send a larger default output-token budget through the Builder gateway so long Plan Mode responses do not inherit a short gateway default.
- ce9e355: Scope agent chat screen and URL context to the originating browser tab.
- d1a90ac: Fix Builder "Upgrade at builder.io" link in chat dropping users on `/app/projects` instead of billing. The link previously deep-linked to `/app/organizations/<BUILDER_ORG_NAME>/billing`, but `BUILDER_ORG_NAME` is the org's display name (e.g. `Nicholas kipchumba Space`), not a URL-safe slug — Builder's router didn't recognize it and silently redirected to `/app/projects`. The CLI-auth callback doesn't expose an org slug or id today, so the link now always points to `https://builder.io/account/billing`, which resolves the active org from session.
- d1a90ac: Promote `upload-image` to a core sharing action: register it in `mergeCoreSharingActions` so every template inherits the agent-callable image-upload tool without each app having to re-declare it in `actions/`.
- ce9e355: Default Dispatch vault access to all workspace apps, add manual grant mode, sync vault keys into encrypted app secrets, and fix org-scoped vault listing.
- ce9e355: Save generated workspace app descriptions, make Dispatch app metadata editable, and include workspace app names/descriptions in A2A agent context.
- ce9e355: Workspace dev gateway pages (loading + index) now respect `prefers-color-scheme` and render in dark mode when the user's OS is set to dark.
- 64792af: Show workspace dev child-process failures on the startup page instead of hiding them behind a generic reload loop.
- d1a90ac: CLI: probe each app's port before spawning Vite so the workspace dev server doesn't die on a single port conflict. `pnpm dev` previously assigned each app a fixed port (`8100`, `8101`, …) and spawned Vite with `--strictPort` for the gateway routing; if anything on the host already owned that port, Vite failed hard before the gateway could route around it. The workspace now binds a probe TCP socket on each candidate port before commiting to it, increments past collisions, and logs the substitution. The same probe runs in the live filesystem-sync path so a newly-scaffolded app added with `agent-native add-app` doesn't trip on a busy port either. Includes a related CLI scaffolding spinner tweak — the per-app message now distinguishes "Downloading X template…" (slow GitHub fetch) from "Configuring X…" (fast local rewrite) so users don't watch a frozen "Scaffolding…" message during the network step. `runWorkspaceDev` is now async (returns `Promise<WorkspaceDevHandle>`); the two in-tree callers already chained `.then()`, so no external API change.
- ce9e355: Prefer the public auth origin (`APP_URL` / `BETTER_AUTH_URL` / `WORKSPACE_OAUTH_ORIGIN`) over the workspace gateway URL when resolving Google OAuth redirect URIs, on both server and client. Filter out loopback gateway origins so dev workspaces don't accidentally redirect to localhost in production. The workspace dev runner forwards the resolved origin to per-app processes via `VITE_WORKSPACE_OAUTH_ORIGIN`.

### Patch Changes

- db11073: Fix workspace scaffolds of `slides` and `videos` failing with `ERR_PNPM_WORKSPACE_PKG_NOT_FOUND` for `@agent-native/pinpoint`. Both templates depend on pinpoint but were not declaring it in `requiredPackages`, so it never got copied into `packages/pinpoint` and the `workspace:*` reference could not resolve.

## 0.14.7

### Patch Changes

- 63e641a: Add rich Sentry tags (model, gatewayOrigin, gatewayRequestId) for no-detail Builder gateway errors and fix the user-facing copy to stop promising auto-recovery and model switching, which don't actually help for this error code.
- 63e641a: Stop `Error: socket hang up` unhandled rejections from polluting Sentry on
  AWS Lambda (Sentry AGENT-NATIVE-BROWSER-4 — 24k events / 199 users in 48h).
  The MCP `StreamableHTTPClientTransport` opens long-lived sockets for SSE
  long-polls; AWS reaps those sockets ~60s after a Lambda invocation returns
  200, and the next thaw delivers a `Socket.socketOnEnd` whose Promise has
  nobody left to await it. Two changes:
  - `server/sentry.ts` `beforeSend` drops `socket hang up` events whose
    mechanism is `onunhandledrejection` and whose stack includes
    `Socket.socketOnEnd` / `node:_http_client`. Real socket-hang-up errors
    with a different mechanism or non-HTTP-client stack still report.
  - `mcp-client/manager.ts` attaches a no-op `transport.onerror` before
    `client.connect()` so SDK fire-and-forget paths (initial SSE stream
    open, scheduled reconnects) can't surface as unhandled rejections in
    the window before Client wires its own handler. `Client.connect()`
    chains its own onerror on top of ours, so post-connect errors still
    flow through the existing `client.onerror` recorder.

- 63e641a: Fix `MessageRepository(addOrUpdateMessage): Parent message not found` unhandled
  rejection in the agent prompt composer (Sentry AGENT-NATIVE-BROWSER-18). The
  assistant-ui local runtime can clear or relink its message map between the
  `append` that adds the user message and the `performRoundtrip` call that
  records the assistant placeholder (history-adapter load, branch reset, repeat
  imports). When that race fires the runtime threw an internal-bug error that
  masked the original error from chatModel.run() and surfaced as a Sentry
  unhandled rejection on the user's first send. The fix patches the underlying
  `MessageRepository.addOrUpdateMessage` to relink the message to the current
  head (or root) when the requested parent is missing, instead of throwing.

## 0.14.6

### Patch Changes

- 7992922: Hide the CLI tab in the agent sidebar when embedded inside the Builder.io frame. Code editing in that context happens via Builder, and the CLI panel only offered a Download Desktop CTA, so the tab added clutter without value. If the persisted panel mode was `cli`, it now auto-switches to `chat` once embedded.
- 7992922: fix(chat): three related chat-history fixes that landed together.
  - New `normalizeThreadRepository()` walks an imported repo, drops messages without an id, and rewrites missing or dangling `parentId` references to the previous-seen message id (or `null` for the head). assistant-ui's `threadRuntime.import()` rejects the whole repo with `Parent message not found` if even one entry has a stale parent, which used to wipe the entire thread on refresh after a partial save. Both `mergeThreadDataForClientSave` (server-side merge) and `AssistantChat`'s import path now run through it.
  - `chat-threads/store` derives `messageCount` from `thread_data` on read via `normalizeThreadRepository`, and drops summary rows where the derived count is `0`. The chat-history sidebar now reflects only real conversations even if a row sneaks in with `message_count = 0`.
  - `isInternalContinuationError` no longer classifies `builder_gateway_error` (or the loose `"gateway error"` message-substring match) as a continuation. PR #634 dropped this code from the client's auto-recover allow-list and capped the server retry budget; this finishes the picture so the visible thread surfaces a normal error card instead of hiding the failure behind the silent-continuation filter.
  - Thread-data writes now use an `updated_at` compare-and-swap retry loop and remerge message history against the latest DB row before each retry, so cross-process serverless writers no longer blindly clobber each other. Client restore/reconnect also refuses obviously stale server snapshots that would replace a richer local runtime.

- 7992922: Add `?authMode=popup` / `?authMode=redirect` query-param override to the Google sign-in flow, allowing per-session testing of either flow without flipping the global `GOOGLE_AUTH_MODE` env var or shipping a default-behavior change.

## 0.14.5

### Patch Changes

- fa3189e: fix(thread persist): every user message was getting duplicated in `chat_threads` because the runtime export (assistant-ui's `saveThreadData`) wrote `attachments: []` while the server-side `persistSubmittedUserMessage` → `buildUserMessage` path omitted the field entirely. The fingerprint used to dedupe in `messageIdentityKeys` couldn't see them as the same message — `[]` and `undefined` hashed differently. Now normalize the attachments slot through `normalizeAttachmentIdentity` (which collapses both shapes to `undefined`) so duplicates merge instead of stacking up as `client_user → assistant → server_user` triples.
- fa3189e: Mirror Google Slides' sharing behavior in the framework `ShareButton` and SSR runtime:
  - Wrap SSR loaders in `runWithRequestContext` so React Router loaders see the signed-in user via `getRequestUserEmail()` / `accessFilter()`. Fixes a bug where shared admins (and even owners) hit 404 on access-controlled SSR routes unless visibility was set to public.
  - `ShareButton` now supports an optional `secondaryShareUrl` (with `secondaryShareUrlLabel` / `secondaryShareUrlDescription`) so a resource can expose two copyable URLs — e.g. an editor link and a read-only / presentation link — in the same share dialog.
  - `shareUrlRequiresPublic` (and the related `shareUrlUnavailableDescription`) is now a no-op and deprecated. Access is enforced on the resource itself, not the URL shape, matching Google Slides — copying a link no longer requires flipping visibility to public.

## 0.14.4

### Patch Changes

- e9d5dac: Return Builder cloud OAuth completions to the active preview proxy host instead of raw loopback URLs.
- e9d5dac: fix(chat): stop the "agent regenerates the reply 4+ times in a loop" runaway when the Builder gateway emits a no-detail error

  End-to-end repro on slides production showed the agent emitting `{activity, tool_start, tool_done, tool_start, tool_done, clear, clear, clear, error}` with `errorCode: "builder_gateway_error"`, then the client sending another `POST /agent-chat` to auto-continue, which got the same gateway error, which auto-continued again — up to **4 server runs for one user message** until the gateway returned 503. Each run wiped visible content via `clear` events and re-streamed from scratch. That's the "agent does some work, deletes its reply, regenerates, gets stuck in a loop" symptom users were hitting.

  Two changes:
  - **client (`sse-event-processor.ts`):** `builder_gateway_error` is no longer in `isAutoRecoverableError`'s recoverable list. That code is the no-detail Builder gateway fallback (gateway emitted `{type:"stop",reason:"error"}` with no explanation — almost always upstream provider giving up: model quota hit, account misconfiguration, opaque downstream failure). The production-agent already retries it synchronously inside the run before the error escapes to the SSE stream, so by the time the client sees it the server has given up — auto-continuing on top of that just sends another POST that hits the same wall. Surfaces the error to the user as a "Something went wrong" card instead of looping up to 32 transient continuations. Also removed `"gateway error"` from the message-substring matcher to stay consistent with the code-based check.
  - **server (`production-agent.ts`):** Cap the in-run retry budget for `builder_gateway_error` at 1 (down from `MAX_RETRIES = 3`). Same rationale — retrying the same call against a misbehaving Builder route rarely recovers, and each retry emits a `clear` event that wipes the user's visible content. Three cycles of "regenerate, clear, regenerate" inside a single run is bad UX for a failure mode where retrying doesn't help. Other retryable codes (`http_5xx`, `builder_gateway_network_error`, rate limits, transport blips) keep the original 3-attempt budget. New `maxRetriesForError(err)` helper gates this so we can extend per-code overrides later without touching the loop.

## 0.14.3

### Patch Changes

- 740bca9: ux(extensions sidebar): trim the section header's right padding from `pr-24` to `pr-20`. The previous value reserved space for icons that were since removed; the new value lines up cleanly with the action buttons that are actually rendered.

## 0.14.2

### Patch Changes

- 704951d: Agent run-store: stop the bug that caused the user-facing `run_terminal_event_missing` error from happening in the first place. The reaper paths (`reapIfStale`, `reapAllStaleRuns`, `cleanupOldRuns`, `markRunAborted`) used to call `appendTerminalRunEvent(...).catch(() => {})`, silently dropping transient SQL errors and stranding reconnecting clients with bare `status='errored'` rows. They now go through `safeAppendTerminalRunEvent` — one retry after a 100ms backoff, then a structured `captureError` to Sentry on persistent failure. `cleanupOldRuns` also broadens its terminal-event-append SELECT to cover the 24h-age UPDATE in addition to the heartbeat-stale one (an old run with a somehow-fresh heartbeat would previously be flipped to `errored` without a terminal event).
- 704951d: Return Builder desktop Google sign-in to the local workspace gateway and bridge the OAuth session back with `_session`.
- 704951d: Stop chat history from "reverting" mid-conversation: `useChatThreads.fetchThreads` now reconciles per-thread instead of replacing wholesale, so a server fetch that arrives a few hundred ms behind a fresh local update no longer rolls the recent-chats list back to older timestamps. The active thread is also kept visible in the History popover (and highlighted as `Active`) even when its `messageCount` is still zero, so a brand-new chat doesn't appear to vanish from the list right after opening.
- 704951d: fix(chat): stop creating empty `chat_threads` rows on every page mount + recover from stale active threads

  Two related fixes that together prevent `chat_threads` from filling up with ghost rows and prevent users from getting stuck on an active id the server doesn't know about:
  - `useChatThreads` no longer optimistically `POST`s `/_agent-native/agent-chat/threads` when synthesizing a thread id for the composer. The previous flow inserted an empty `chat_threads` row (`message_count=0`, no linked `agent_runs`) on every page mount and every "+" click, even when the user never sent a message. The agent run's server-side `persistSubmittedUserMessage` already creates the row idempotently the moment the user sends, so the client just adds the thread to local state. Rows now land in `chat_threads` only when there's a real conversation behind them.
  - When the saved active thread id isn't on the server AND wasn't created locally this session, the hook now drops the user on the most-recent real thread instead of leaving them on a stale composer that the server has no record of. The `newlyCreatedRef` check disambiguates: only optimistic-this-session ids stay active; ids from a previous session whose row was cleaned up get swapped out.

  Per-thread merge in `fetchThreads` (already shipped) keeps in-flight optimistic threads visible until the server learns about them, so the chat list still shows the user's current thread without flicker.

- 704951d: Two small UI primitives:
  - Prompt composer: click an attached image to open a fullscreen preview (Esc / click-outside to close). The thumbnail's X button still removes.
  - Agent sidebar: new `window.dispatchEvent(new Event("agent-panel:close"))` event mirrors the existing `agent-panel:open` so apps can collapse the sidebar programmatically (used by the design template's Edit mode to free up canvas space).

- 704951d: Agent SSE reconnect: replace the cryptic `run_terminal_event_missing` error with the friendlier stale-run message, and persist it back to SQL so future reconnects replay the proper terminal event instead of regenerating it. This path triggers when an `agent_runs` row was flipped to `errored` but the terminal event write was lost (e.g. a reaper's `appendTerminalRunEvent(...).catch(() => {})` swallowed a transient DB error). The user-facing situation is identical to a stale-run reap, so the UI now shows "The agent stopped before it could finish" with `recoverable: true` (offering retry) instead of the debug-string error.

## 0.14.1

### Patch Changes

- 513aac1: fix(chat): recover from chats disappearing from sidebar history

  Two changes that together restore the pre-#621 behavior where the chat history list always reflects the server:
  - **client**: Stop hydrating chat messages from a per-thread `localStorage` cache, and stop synthesizing a fresh UUID active thread inside the `useState` initializer. The cache could mask stale or partially-saved threads, and the synthesized id raced with the agent run's server-side `persistSubmittedUserMessage` create — when the client's `POST /threads` then lost the race, its `.catch` was yanking the freshly-created thread out of local state. Active thread is now resolved against the server's threads list (most-recent fallback if the saved id isn't there); thread messages are loaded from the server. The `agent-chat-active-thread` localStorage key still persists which thread the user last had focused.
  - **server**: Make `POST /_agent-native/agent-chat/threads` idempotent. When the request body's `id` matches an existing thread owned by the same user, return that thread instead of failing on the SQL UNIQUE constraint. This also means a flaky network retry of `POST /threads` no longer 500s after the agent's `onRunPrepared` already inserted the row.

- 513aac1: refactor(agent): extract `runAgentLoopDirectWithSoftTimeout` (the soft-timeout + resumable-error continuation wrapper) out of `agent-chat-plugin.ts` into a dedicated `run-loop-with-resume.ts`, with unit and integration spec coverage for the soft-timeout path, gateway-timeout resume, network-interrupt resume, the `MAX_RUN_LOOP_CONTINUATIONS=6` cap, and upstream-abort handling.

  Also bumps `DEFAULT_BUILDER_GATEWAY_TIMEOUT_MS` from 45s to the existing 55s cap so design generation and other long-output workloads get the full per-call budget Lambda's 75s function limit allows. 55s leaves ~20s headroom for response streaming + the soft-timeout continuation path.

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- 04fe544: feat(agent): resume runs that get cut off by upstream gateway timeouts (Builder gateway, HTTP 502/503/504, serverless function timeouts) or transport-level interruptions (socket hang up, ECONNRESET, fetch failed, stream closed) instead of failing the run.

  The `auto_continue` event's `reason` union picks up two new values — `gateway_timeout` and `network_interrupted` — so clients can show a precise message. Internally the agent gets a one-line continuation note describing how it was interrupted, then resumes from the same conversation prefix (Anthropic prompt cache rescues the latency) and finishes the user's original request without redoing completed work.

- 04fe544: feat(auth): when `COOKIE_DOMAIN` is set (e.g. `.agent-native.com` for first-party deploys where each app is its own subdomain), the framework session cookie is shared across every subdomain. The cookie name becomes the unsuffixed `an_session` and a `Domain=<COOKIE_DOMAIN>` attribute is added on every set/clear, so signing into one app signs the user into every sibling app under the same parent domain.

  Better Auth's session cookie picks up the same domain via its `crossSubDomainCookies` advanced option, so its cookie and the legacy framework cookie stay in sync across subdomains.

  Falls back to the existing per-app and workspace-mode cookie naming when `COOKIE_DOMAIN` is unset, so non-first-party deploys keep their origin-scoped cookies.

- 04fe544: feat(extensions/fetch-tool): the `web-request` tool now sends realistic Chrome-on-macOS headers (User-Agent, Accept, Sec-Fetch-\*, Upgrade-Insecure-Requests, etc.) by default so sites with anti-bot middleware (Cloudflare, PerimeterX, Akamai) respond normally instead of returning challenge pages. Caller-supplied headers always win, so API calls with Authorization keep their values untouched.

  Also raise the response truncation cap from 8k to 32k chars so the agent can read a full article or scraped table in one shot.

- 04fe544: feat(onboarding): pick Google sign-in flow with `GOOGLE_AUTH_MODE` env var (`auto` | `popup` | `redirect`, default `auto`). Auto uses a popup in normal browsers, a full-page redirect inside Electron, and a popup inside the Builder.io browser iframe (Google rejects framing). The new `resolveGoogleAuthMode()` server helper is also exported from `@agent-native/core/server/google-auth-mode` for callers that need to pass an explicit mode.

### Patch Changes

- 04fe544: Auto-send the user's pending prompt the moment Builder.io connection
  completes. The Connect Builder card carries the user's original ask as
  its `prompt` prop; previously the OAuth popup closing left them staring
  at a "Send to Builder" button as if they had to retype it. The card now
  fires the send automatically once `connecting` flips false with a
  configured Builder, but only if the user actually clicked Connect this
  session — revisiting an already-connected card still requires an
  explicit click so old threads don't replay on re-open.
- 04fe544: fix(agent prompt): two routing tweaks for connect-builder.
  - Add an "Extensions vs. Code Changes — Pick the Right Path" section so the agent prefers `create-extension` for new self-contained surfaces (widgets, dashboards, lists, viewers) and only falls back to `connect-builder` when the request modifies the host app's existing chrome.
  - Make the agent briefly acknowledge the user's specific ask before handing off to Builder, and reword the post-card sentence around what the user just asked for instead of leading with a generic Builder pitch.

- 04fe544: - db/neon: Attach a logging error listener to the Neon serverless Pool. Without one, Node 24 surfaces routine WebSocket drops (idle timeout, Lambda suspend, network blip) as fatal `Unhandled error` / `Connection terminated unexpectedly` uncaught exceptions even though the next query would have transparently reconnected. The pool now logs and swallows these so they don't crash the function or fill Sentry.
  - server/sentry: Drop 4xx HTTPError / H3Error from `beforeSend`. h3's `createError({ statusCode: 4xx })` is the documented way to return 404 / 400 / 401 from a route — those bubble through Nitro's error hook and were getting captured as Sentry issues. Match by statusCode when present, fall back to message heuristics ("not found", "Cannot find any route matching", "No access to …", "Unauthenticated") so handler-thrown 4xx don't bury real bugs.
- 04fe544: fix: avoid spurious failures in two edge cases.
  - `agent_run_events` writes now use `ON CONFLICT (run_id, seq) DO NOTHING` so a `pendingTerminalEvent`-reserved seq getting reused, or `appendTerminalRunEvent` racing with the producer's final event, no longer leaves the run in an inconsistent terminal state.
  - `fetchPollJson` in `use-db-sync` now awaits `res.json()` inside the `try` before the timeout `finally` runs, so a body-stream abort can't escape as an unhandled rejection.

- 04fe544: - AssistantChat: clearer Builder-setup card copy ("Turn on the AI assistant" / "One click to connect Builder for free hosted access — no API keys needed").
  - Sentry: drop `AgentAutoContinueSignal` (control-flow sentinel) on the browser side and `ForbiddenError` / `UnauthorizedError` on the server side from captured events. They aren't real failures and were burying actionable bugs in the Sentry issue list.
- 04fe544: ux(agent prompt): after finishing a task with obvious recurring value (daily triage, weekly digests, monthly cleanup), the agent now offers to save it as a recurring job in one short closing line, then calls `manage-jobs(create)` if the user confirms. Skips the offer for one-shot lookups, single drafts/replies, and prompts that already specify a cadence.
- 04fe544: fix(dispatch): make the `/dispatch/<appId>` server-side bounce work in production deploys and after live workspace changes by reading the same env-→file-→filesystem manifest fallback chain that the rest of agent discovery uses, instead of only checking `AGENT_NATIVE_WORKSPACE_APPS_JSON`.

  Core now exports `loadWorkspaceAppsManifest()` and the `WorkspaceAppManifestEntry` type from `@agent-native/core/server/agent-discovery`, so other server entrypoints can resolve the workspace manifest without re-implementing the fallback.

- 04fe544: Strengthen the `create-extension` tool description so the agent generates more
  robust extensions: prefer `<script>` + `Alpine.data('name', () => ({...}))`
  for any non-trivial component instead of stuffing methods, branching, and
  template literals into an inline `x-data="..."` attribute (HTML parser
  pitfalls cause `ReferenceError` failures); require a real LLM key via
  `${keys.*}` for AI features or route the AI work to the agent chat instead
  of shipping a stubbed analysis step.
- 04fe544: Fix Extensions sidebar header so the info-circle icon no longer overlaps the title text on narrow widths. Title now truncates cleanly and the info button only appears on row hover.
- 04fe544: fix(auth): share the framework session cookie across all apps in workspace mode + add `Partitioned` to the cookie attributes so it survives Builder.io's iframe + Chrome's third-party-cookie deprecation.

  Two related issues were combining to break workspace SSO:
  1. The framework cookie name was suffixed with `APP_NAME` (`an_session_dispatch`, `an_session_todo`, etc.) to prevent template ping-ponging in `dev:all`. In workspace mode every app shares the same origin **and** the same DB, so per-app suffixes were the wrong default and killed cross-app sign-in. Workspace apps now share `an_session_workspace`.
  2. The framework cookie was set with `SameSite=None; Secure` but no `Partitioned` attribute, so the Builder OAuth popup → main-iframe handoff dropped the cookie under Chrome's third-party storage partitioning. Better Auth's own cookie already has `Partitioned: true`; this brings the framework's legacy cookie in line.

  After this change, signing into one workspace app (Dispatch in builder-workspace) means you're signed in across the workspace's other apps too, and the agent chat sidebar's auth check stops looping back to the login page on subsequent app loads.

## 0.13.1

### Patch Changes

- 051fcac: Swap `AgentPresenceChip`, `PresenceBar`, and `agent-identity` accent colors to the agent-native brand blues (#00B5FF / #48FFE4) so presence indicators match the new analytics chart palette.
- 051fcac: Route Builder desktop Google sign-in through the configured public OAuth origin so the centralized callback host mints and redeems the OAuth state.

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 98d56cd: Surface a user-visible "this chat looks stuck" affordance when an agent run goes silent. The server now tracks a durable `last_progress_at` timestamp on every emitted event (distinct from the process-liveness `heartbeat_at`); `/runs/active` returns it; and a new `useRunStuckDetection` hook + `RunStuckBanner` component poll it from the client. After 90s without progress — past the adapter's 75s no-progress reconnect — the banner appears with Retry / Cancel buttons. `MultiTabAssistantChat` wires this in by default, with Retry sending a continuation prompt via the existing chat handle. `trackEvent` calls fire on stuck-detected, retry, and cancel so we can finally see the long tail of stuck-chat incidents in analytics instead of relying on user reports.

### Patch Changes

- 98d56cd: Make the chat sidebar paint instantly on open instead of blocking behind network round-trips. `useChatThreads` now seeds an optimistic active thread synchronously on mount — either from localStorage or a freshly-generated UUID — and persists it server-side in the background. For existing chats, every save also writes the thread data to a localStorage cache, and `AssistantChat` hydrates from that cache synchronously so the message bubbles paint on first commit; the server fetch still runs in the background to refresh, and is skipped as a no-op when the server data is identical to the cache.
- 98d56cd: Composer + menu now reads "Create Extension" (was "Create Tool") and "Schedule Task" (was "Scheduled Task") to match the imperative tense of the other menu items.
- 98d56cd: Reword waitlisted Builder Cloud Agents UI from "unavailable" to "coming soon" in the connect card and code-required dialog.

## 0.12.40

### Patch Changes

- dd3090e: When the agent chat is open in a plain browser tab on localhost, source-code work via the dev handler kills the chat session — Vite HMR and full page reloads cancel the in-flight run. The chat adapter now sends `x-agent-native-surface: desktop | frame | browser`, and the server forces the prod handler (no shell / no fs) on the chat-in-browser-on-localdev surface and prepends a redirect block telling the agent to point users at Agent-Native Desktop, Claude Code, Codex, or Builder.io for code changes instead of trying to edit source itself.

## 0.12.39

### Patch Changes

- e4f6cf3: Workspace dev gateway pages (loading + index) now respect `prefers-color-scheme` and render in dark mode when the user's OS is set to dark.
- e4f6cf3: Prefer the public auth origin (`APP_URL` / `BETTER_AUTH_URL` / `WORKSPACE_OAUTH_ORIGIN`) over the workspace gateway URL when resolving Google OAuth redirect URIs, on both server and client. Filter out loopback gateway origins so dev workspaces don't accidentally redirect to localhost in production. The workspace dev runner forwards the resolved origin to per-app processes via `VITE_WORKSPACE_OAUTH_ORIGIN`.

## 0.12.31

### Patch Changes

- 88f206f: Open workspace settings to the relevant settings section and update chat history wording.
- 88f206f: Extract the QuestionFlow primitive from the design / videos / slides templates into a shared `GuidedQuestionFlow` (plus `useGuidedQuestionFlow` hook and helpers `formatGuidedAnswerValue`, `formatGuidedAnswersForAgent`, `getOtherGuidedAnswerText`, `hasGuidedAnswer`, `isOtherGuidedAnswer`, `makeOtherGuidedAnswer`, `normalizeGuidedAnswers`). Templates that need question-driven generation can now consume the same component instead of forking ~400 lines of UI each.
- 88f206f: Improve agent chat tool-call detail display and disable lazy route-discovery manifest polling in template configs.
- 88f206f: Stamp `requestMode` on every assistant chunk's metadata so the chat surface can tell which mode each turn was actually generated under. The Plan-mode "Implement Plan" CTA now requires the latest assistant message to be a plan response, instead of triggering on any assistant message while the global toggle is plan. Also let the chat history popover include currently-open tabs (marked "Open" instead of a timestamp) so users see their full thread list.
- 88f206f: Prevent copying public-only share links before the resource is public.
- 88f206f: Await persistence of terminal run events before writing the final run status, and skip the status update if the terminal-event SQL write fails — so reconnects can no longer observe `status='errored'` without the corresponding error payload, and the heartbeat-stale reaper retries the run cleanly. Also forces the settings panel to re-apply `initialSection` when the same value is requested twice via a new `sectionRequestKey` prop, and updates the dev overlay shortcut hint to render `Cmd+Ctrl+A` on Mac and `Ctrl+Alt+A` elsewhere.
- 88f206f: Add an optional `id` prop on `SettingsSection` so callers can deep-link or scroll to a specific section. The `agent-panel:open-settings` CustomEvent now accepts an optional `detail.section` field that AgentPanel forwards to the settings panel as `initialSection`. Rename the chat-history toggle copy to "All chats".
- 88f206f: Persist terminal agent-run events before final run status updates so reconnects replay the real outcome.
- 88f206f: Stream `/_agent-native/events` SSE for in-process change events as the fast path for `useDbSync`, with the existing `/_agent-native/poll` endpoint as the cross-process / serverless fallback. When the SSE stream is connected, the polling interval relaxes to 15 s; if the server can't reach the client (or the consumer passes `sseUrl: false`), polling continues at the original cadence. Tool-call cards in `AssistantChat` now expose copy-to-clipboard buttons on the input and result panes.
- 88f206f: Open the agent settings panel when selecting Workspace settings from the organization switcher.

## 0.12.30

### Patch Changes

- 419988f: Surface a visible "model returned an empty response" message when an engine ends a turn with reasoning-only content and zero output text (e.g. OpenAI gpt-5+ Responses runs where reasoning consumes the entire output-token budget). Previously the SSE stream finished cleanly with no text, producing a silent empty assistant bubble.
- 419988f: Add an optional `prepareRequest` hook on `ProductionAgentOptions` and `AgentChatPluginOptions` so templates can normalize the inbound chat request — materialize uploaded attachments into per-template file handles, rewrite the message, or append non-visible instructions — between owner resolution and system/context assembly. Re-export `AgentChatAttachment` from the core entry points so templates can type the hook's payload.
- 419988f: Add a server-side agent chat request preparation hook for templates to materialize uploaded attachments before a run starts.

## 0.12.29

### Patch Changes

- 4c90b33: Use Claude Sonnet as the default Builder gateway chat model.

## 0.12.28

### Patch Changes

- fd1cc43: Add Google OAuth handoff debug breadcrumbs for Builder-hosted sign-in flows.
- fd1cc43: Pause `useDbSync`, `useScreenRefreshKey`, `usePausingInterval`, and `useCollaborativeDoc` polling while the tab is hidden so background tabs do not keep waking the network. Restores polling on focus and visibility change. The new `pauseWhenHidden` option defaults to `true`; pass `false` to keep the legacy always-on behaviour. Also expand `useDbSync`'s default invalidation set to include `app-state`, `navigate-command`, `show-questions`, and `__set_url__`, so framework-managed application-state keys stay in sync without templates having to opt in by passing `queryKeys`. The `/_agent-native/poll` endpoint now subscribes to in-process `app-state` and `settings` emitters and records changes directly, skipping a DB scan when the event happened on the same Node instance, and forwards an `owner` field on every event so clients can match it to the active session.
- fd1cc43: Allow per-message plan/act override via `runConfig.custom.requestMode` so the chat composer can flip a single user turn into Implement Plan without changing the global Plan/Act toggle.

## 0.12.27

### Patch Changes

- 08d4113: Broaden composer upload filters so Markdown, JSON, CSV, DOCX, and PPTX reference files are selectable in native file pickers.
- 08d4113: Buffer streamed assistant text until the final-response guard approves it, so rejected answers never flash before the corrective retry. Removes the `clear` event the UI used to swallow.
- 08d4113: Improve assistant chat embed previews and sub-agent task card labels.
- 08d4113: Clear stale chat activity when corrective agent retries discard partial output.
- 08d4113: Add Preview header bar to IframeEmbed showing the embed's title above the iframe.
- c195ddd: Include installed database packages in Node serverless bundles so hosted apps do not fail loading local database fallbacks.
- 08d4113: Use the PostgreSQL client for all URLs so serverless bundles no longer depend on platform-specific native packages. The deploy bundler still copies required packages into Netlify/Vercel/Lambda outputs as a safety net.
- 08d4113: Bundle agent chat feedback controls with the main client entry so missing lazy chunks cannot crash the agent panel.
- 08d4113: Show visible assistant error text for chat authentication failures instead of blank messages.

## 0.12.26

- 1155964: Keep hosted chat credential isolation intact and show visible missing-credential errors.
- 1155964: Read legacy workspace-scoped Builder credentials so users who connected before org scoping no longer see "missing key" errors.

## 0.12.24

### Patch Changes

- d198100: Polish setup, navigation, editor, and feedback affordances from user feedback.
- d198100: Preserve chat attachments and completed history during interrupted-run recovery.
- d198100: Fix stale collaboration presence cleanup, stale run handling, and agent panel recovery.

## 0.12.23

### Patch Changes

- e752afd: Require request-scoped Builder or LLM credentials for signed-in users on hosted shared-database apps.
- e752afd: Use neutral composer styling when Plan mode is active.
- e752afd: Contain failed remote MCP handshakes and show concise connection errors.
- e752afd: Quiet the optional node-pty missing notice unless terminal debug logging is enabled.
- e752afd: Keep the Workspace docs tooltip from overlapping the panel header.
- e752afd: Improve Sentry signal for Builder gateway network failures and browser analytics noise.
- e752afd: Use the request-context owner when resolving explicit agent engine credentials.
- e752afd: Preserve uploaded attachments on queued chat messages and stringify screen context objects.

## 0.12.22

- 1ba9738: Use the AI SDK's default OpenAI Responses path for first-party OpenAI agent models.
- 1ba9738: Show a Builder reconnect action when agent chat hits Builder or model-provider auth errors.

## 0.12.21

### Patch Changes

- 0d95d53: Restore production Plan mode in the agent sidebar and clarify read-only planning before production writes.
- 0d95d53: Fix prompt composer model selection in embedded prompt dialogs.
- 0d95d53: Add generic client/server error capture helpers and report agent chat run failures through configured capture providers.

## 0.12.20

### Patch Changes

- 715eda8: Fix sidebar popover clipping, terminal startup visibility, automation test routing, and tiny usage rounding.
- 715eda8: Add Vercel workspace deploy packaging and make the shared-token login gate provider-neutral.
- 715eda8: Reduce noisy CLI Sentry reports for handled workspace watcher limits and skip first-party agent symlinks during GitHub tarball extraction on Windows.
- 715eda8: Collect browser and server Sentry errors from shared DSN deploy configuration.
- 715eda8: Add `vercel` as a third workspace-deploy preset alongside `cloudflare_pages` and `netlify`. When `preset=vercel`, the build emits into `.vercel/output` so the standard Vercel build pipeline picks it up unmodified.

## 0.12.19

### Patch Changes

- 3b88628: Disable Plan mode in local browser dev surfaces and point users to Agent-Native Desktop for planning.
- 3b88628: Use cross-site session cookie attributes for Google OAuth sessions so embedded app chat remains authenticated.
- 3b88628: Default the framework to the Builder gateway's `gpt-5-5` model alias, centralize built-in engine model defaults/catalogs in `model-config.ts`, and stop hard-coding `DEFAULT_MODEL` for A2A / MCP / integrations runs — the resolved engine's default is used instead. Also adds a "Use Builder" cloud CTA alongside the Desktop CTA in the AgentPanel and CodeRequiredDialog code-access-unavailable surfaces, including a `useBuilderConnectUrl()` hook that wires up the secondary link from `/_agent-native/builder/status`.
- 3b88628: Fix lazy workspace dev root routing, live app discovery, and generated app dependency startup.
- 3b88628: Keep oversized pasted-text chat attachments from overflowing agent context and render them consistently as pasted-text chips.

## 0.12.18

### Patch Changes

- c17f651: Reorder agent-engine resolution so a Builder-connected user always wins over a stale settings row. Add `isStoredEngineUsableForRequest` so per-user `app_secrets` (Builder or BYOK) are recognized when deciding whether a stored engine is usable, and update `/agent-engine/status` and the engine picker to honor the same priority chain at request time.
- c17f651: Polish OAuth callback close-tab success and error page spacing.

## 0.12.17

### Patch Changes

- ad7006d: Block frame-routed code submissions when local source access is unavailable and point users to Agent-Native Desktop for code, CLI, and Workspace access.
- ad7006d: Keep workspace app creation prompts editable after submit and clarify that named products are design references, not implied API-key requirements.
- ad7006d: Fix Plan mode selector mouse interaction and remove keyboard-shortcut wording from user-facing mode guidance.
- ad7006d: Suppress benign Vite connection-reset error overlays and keep narrow composer controls contained.

## 0.12.16

### Patch Changes

- 27c3dbc: Submit a pending email invite when closing the share popover with Done.
- 27c3dbc: Clarify provider-specific tool routing so named external sources win over generic warehouse tools.
- 27c3dbc: Improve chat run completion durability and clarify mounted workspace app routing.
- 27c3dbc: Preserve public forwarded host/protocol headers when proxying workspace apps so Google OAuth redirect URIs use the stable gateway origin instead of internal app dev ports.

## 0.12.15

### Patch Changes

- b07f933: Export the Builder agent engine for template media pipelines.
- b07f933: Clarify workspace app creation instructions to reuse hosted first-party apps as A2A neighbors instead of cloning or nesting templates.
- b07f933: Make extension removal handle shared extensions and refresh installed widgets cleanly.

## 0.12.14

### Patch Changes

- 5115f28: Add Dispatch knowledge packs to workspace resources and let new-app flows grant them alongside vault keys.
- 5115f28: Add an optional run-local command CTA to auth marketing pages.
- 5115f28: Retry workspace app dev servers after early launch failures during local app creation.

## 0.12.13

- b1595cc: Allow Builder Connect to override deploy-level Builder credentials with request-scoped credentials.
- b1595cc: Improve Builder transcription error detail and remove OpenAI-specific fallback guidance.

## 0.12.12

### Patch Changes

- 4caaa4f: Keep workspace app creation on same-origin gateway routes and stop child dev servers from advertising private ports.
- 4caaa4f: Give the extensions empty state more breathing room.

## 0.12.11

### Patch Changes

- e076977: Hide the share dialog notification checkbox until an email invite is entered.
- e076977: Match the share popover and trigger surfaces to app sidebar backgrounds.
- e076977: Surface tool-input progress in agent chat and recover from stale reconnect streams.
- e076977: Make generated workspace apps preserve their mounted base path and keep Dispatch app links on the active workspace gateway origin.
- e076977: Support stable root OAuth callbacks for path-mounted workspace apps and clarify new-app prompts.

## 0.12.10

### Patch Changes

- f0776fc: Decode extension route path segments so extensionData removal works for item IDs with spaces.
- f0776fc: Keep short pasted text inline in the agent composer and only convert page-sized pastes to attachments.
- f0776fc: Keep agent chat auth prompts scoped to the originating chat and surface streamed provider auth errors as run errors.
- f0776fc: Preserve structured tool history across agent chat recovery turns and suppress duplicate read-only calls during continuations.

## 0.12.9

### Patch Changes

- 7a849c3: Give the shared extensions sidebar header room for its full label and replace the docs icon tooltip with an interactive popover.
- 7a849c3: Include the Images app as a default connected A2A agent and guide agents to use it for generated imagery.
- 7a849c3: Images-template library refactor + agent-discovery polish.
- 7a849c3: Remember extension sidebar usage and add collapsible sort controls.

## 0.12.8

### Patch Changes

- fdf8cfc: Align the agent sidebar toggle button with standard top-bar icon controls.

## 0.12.7

### Patch Changes

- 7d0ebfc: Add Builder-managed image generation onboarding support and endpoint helpers.
- 7d0ebfc: Move Mail lower in template pickers, remove non-featured templates from default selections, and add a hosted Mail Google sign-in notice.
- 7d0ebfc: Preserve standard `backdrop-filter` declarations in production CSS builds.
- 7d0ebfc: Allow share dialogs to customize visibility and link copy for template-specific access wording.

## 0.12.6

### Patch Changes

- 471bf1e: Treat invalid chat session tokens as auth failures and make empty command-menu AI prompts open chat.
- 471bf1e: Show Builder.io LLM usage as agent credit spend when Builder is the active provider.
- 471bf1e: Harden agent chat auth and gateway recovery paths.
- 471bf1e: Keep programmatic new-tab chat sends on the requested thread id so UI callers can track run state.
- 471bf1e: Allow the feedback popover's first submit click to load the form schema before sending.
- 471bf1e: Persist the agent chat model selection across page refreshes.
- 471bf1e: Allow notification bells to show clearer empty-state copy.
- 471bf1e: Add optional share notification controls and direct resource links for sharing emails.

## 0.12.5

### Patch Changes

- 2e99cca: Fix workspace scaffolding for the Design template and clarify local Dispatch setup.
- 2e99cca: Shorten the composer model selector reasoning effort label.
- 2e99cca: Send Builder gateway owner headers from the Builder agent engine and keep Builder auth failures out of the app-login flow.
- 2e99cca: Register the `images` template with `hidden:true` in the CLI catalog. The template directory exists in-flight but is intentionally not surfaced in public template lists yet.

## 0.12.4

### Patch Changes

- e2bce24: Keep the prompt composer TipTap schema minimal to avoid ProseMirror recursion in deployed pages.
- e2bce24: Keep existing extension edits on the update-extension path instead of routing them to Builder code changes.
- e2bce24: Recover dev pages when Vite serves outdated optimized dependency 504 responses.

## 0.12.3

### Patch Changes

- d83d5ec: Recognize Images artifacts in cross-app A2A responses.
- d83d5ec: Improve the shared access-token login page with clearer guidance and visible failure states.

## 0.12.2

### Patch Changes

- b878dd8: `agentNative.chatRunning` event now reflects both true and false transitions of `isRunning`, allowing UI consumers to track agent work state in real time.
- b878dd8: Broadcast agent chat running state when normal runs start or stop, and switch the agent panel back to chat when submitting a visible prompt.

## 0.12.1

### Patch Changes

- 47b8486: Avoid duplicate TipTap link extensions when editors provide custom link behavior.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 14f7b63: Add agent-callable extension list, hide, unhide, and delete actions so chat can manage visible extensions without raw SQL.

- 14f7b63: Collapse the extension sidebar list to three items by default.
- 14f7b63: Clarify personal versus organization MCP server scope guidance in the connection UI.
- 14f7b63: Create extensions with private visibility even when the creator belongs to an organization.

## 0.11.4

### Patch Changes

- 24781d0: Clarify Dispatch new-app instructions so Builder branches scaffold separate workspace apps instead of editing starter.
- 24781d0: Add a template hook for retrying guarded final agent answers before they are shown.
- 24781d0: Match the agent sidebar loading header height to the loaded panel header.

## 0.11.3

### Patch Changes

- 81d5b68: Use the Tabler message-dots icon for the agent sidebar toggle.
- 81d5b68: Keep agent DB tools scoped to owner rows when org context is active and rows have no org id.
- 81d5b68: Suppress automatic stale route-chunk reloads inside the Agent-Native desktop app.
- 81d5b68: Harden the public-viewer anonymous-owner resolver: validate Referer origin, require the exact Builder callback path, and discard expired status connect URLs in the embedded settings panel.

## 0.11.2

### Patch Changes

- 8975a96: Allow Builder connect popups to complete from local embedded settings panels by accepting a short-lived signed connect token.
- 8975a96: Polish agent chat menus, icons, and message timestamps.
- 8975a96: Add share-link support to the share button and allow templates to expose read-only anonymous chat and Builder-connect surfaces.

## 0.11.1

### Patch Changes

- 2d52595: Detect Builder preview webviews from builder preview URL markers so code prompts route to Builder chat.
- 2d52595: Use the shadcn popover animation for the framework share control and keep visibility changes fresh after reopening.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- b4bdd34: Workspace settings reachable from the org switcher in every template, plus admin-vs-member roles, bulk invite (typed list, paste-many, CSV upload) with per-row role selection, and stricter auto-join domain validation (must match the admin's own email domain; free email providers like gmail.com are blocked).
  - `OrgSwitcher` exposes a "Workspace settings" link (configurable via `settingsPath`, default `/team`).
  - `useInviteMember` accepts `{ email, role }`; new `useBulkInviteMembers` and `useChangeMemberRole` hooks.
  - New `PUT /_agent-native/org/members/:email/role` endpoint; only owners can promote/demote admins.
  - `org_invitations` gains a `role` column so invites land at the assigned role on accept.
  - `OrgPendingInvitation` type now includes `role`.
  - New `isFreeEmailProvider` export with a curated blocklist used by `setDomainHandler`.

### Patch Changes

- b4bdd34: Replace custom overflow menu in extensions sidebar with shadcn DropdownMenu (Radix-portaled). Fixes the menu being clipped by the sidebar's stacking context and adds the standard fade/zoom animations.
- b4bdd34: Sign connected-agent A2A mention calls with the current request identity in production.
- b4bdd34: Fix Cloudflare Pages deploy failure with `Cannot require: tty`. Terminal-detection helpers in transitive deps (chalk, picocolors, supports-color, debug, etc.) call `require("tty")` at module init; the bundled-worker require shim now covers `tty`, `readline`, `process`, `console`, `perf_hooks`, and `string_decoder` so those CJS calls resolve to the matching ESM imports instead of throwing at deploy time.
- b4bdd34: Allow actions to stop an agent turn after deterministic provider failures instead of feeding the error back into automatic retries.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 721f125: NotificationsBell: clicking a notification with `metadata.link` now navigates to that URL (and marks the notification read). Notifications without a link keep the previous click-to-mark-read-only behavior.

### Patch Changes

- 977af2b: Restyle the Builder connect callback / error pages to match the rest of the framework's UI — Inter font, neutral-zinc palette, and dark/light mode that follows the user's app theme (or `prefers-color-scheme`).
- a562b18: Fix extension table initialization and respect reduced-motion preferences on first-run onboarding backgrounds.
- a562b18: Improve chat stop/error fallback copy and normalize escaped tooltip shortcuts.
- 57b7e0a: Composer accepts file drops directly. Previously, dragging a file (PDF, PPTX, image, etc.) into the prompt composer triggered the browser's default behavior (navigating to the file), even though the "+" button accepted the same file types. The composer now intercepts drops, mirroring the existing paste handler — drag a deck or screenshot in and it attaches like a normal upload.
- 57b7e0a: PromptComposer now inlines small text files (`.txt`, `.md`, `.csv`, `.json`, `.yaml`, etc., plus any `text/*` MIME) into the prompt as `<uploaded-text-file>` blocks instead of only attaching them as binary uploads. Truncates after 60k characters. The original file is still attached as well, so server-side handlers that prefer the binary path keep working.
- 57b7e0a: Resolve org-shared Builder credentials when auto-selecting the chat engine.
- a562b18: Fix queued chat handoff after a run completes and improve multi-invite banner spacing.
- a562b18: Detect Netlify Lambda runtimes for hosted agent soft timeouts and cap repeated stale-run recovery loops.
- a562b18: Fix Vite "Failed to resolve import @tauri-apps/api/core" error in fresh CLI workspaces. The settings panel called `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__.invoke` directly instead of dynamically importing `@tauri-apps/api/core`, so non-desktop installs no longer crash on the first SPA load.
- 57b7e0a: Wrap shadcn `Tooltip` usages in a `TooltipProvider` so the agent panel and other top-level components don't crash on render. PR #509 swapped native `title` hints for `Tooltip`, but `@radix-ui/react-tooltip@1.2.x` requires a provider ancestor and threw `'Tooltip' must be used within 'TooltipProvider'` on the docs site and any template embedding the agent sidebar.
- 977af2b: Route Dispatch overview prompts to Builder chat in Builder frames and keep the app agent sidebar collapsed there by default.
- a562b18: Improve workspace setup feedback and allow adding the Dispatch workspace app from the CLI.
- a562b18: Fix completed chat runs getting restored as permanently thinking after partial thread saves.
- a562b18: Server-side Sentry now attaches user/org context to more error paths. Failed login/signup attempts capture as `level:warning` with `tags.auth:login|signup` and the attempted email pinned to `user.email` (filtered to skip routine bad-credential noise). Every `runWithRequestContext({ userEmail, orgId, ... })` invocation now also tags Sentry's per-request isolation scope, so action handlers, agent-chat tool re-entries, integration webhook processors, and A2A calls all surface errors under the right user even when no session cookie was attached to the request.
- 57b7e0a: Stop reloading the agent chat after Builder or secret configuration updates.
- 57b7e0a: Initialize Sentry inside the Nitro server so 5xx errors thrown by framework routes, action handlers, and agent-chat streams are reported with per-request user context. Driven by the `SENTRY_SERVER_DSN` env var (no-op when unset). Complements the existing CLI and browser Sentry init points without wiring them together — each maps to a different Sentry project.
- a562b18: Improve shared extension shell navigation, creation guidance, and polling recovery.
- a562b18: Recover automatically from no-detail Builder gateway errors in agent chat.
- 57b7e0a: Unify request-scoped secret resolution to read user → org → workspace rows from `app_secrets` everywhere. Previously, `getOwnerApiKey()`, `resolveSecret()`, voice provider status, transcribe-voice, and Google Realtime each had their own slightly different read order — some only checked the user row, some checked user + org but not workspace. They now all walk the same chain, so an org-shared (or workspace-scoped) key is honored consistently no matter which call site resolves it. Solo (no-org) sessions fall back to a `workspace:solo:<email>` row.

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- 4090a2a: PR #511 follow-up fixes:
  - `/runs/active` now surfaces recently-completed and recently-errored SQL runs (within a 10-minute reconnect window) so the agent-chat adapter can replay synthesized done/error events from the run-events stream instead of retrying the original POST when the producer's in-memory state was already evicted (different serverless isolate). Without this, a POST that failed after the server already accepted and finished the run could re-execute the agent turn and double-apply mutations.
  - `/builder/status` now reads the user's active org via `getOrgContext(event)` and passes the orgId into `runWithRequestContext()` so the status poller resolves org-shared Builder credentials. Previously, an admin's org-scope OAuth result was invisible to every other org member's status poller, leaving the UI showing "not connected" even though chat resolved the credentials correctly.
  - Registered secrets routes now treat `scope: "org"` as a first-class scope: writes and deletes require an active org and an owner/admin role (`canMutateOrgScope`), and `resolveScopeId("org", …)` rejects requests without an active org rather than falling back to a `solo:` scopeId. Ad-hoc secret routes were already restricted to `user`/`workspace` and remain unchanged.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 117d476: Builder credentials are now stored at org scope by default when an owner/admin connects, so a single OAuth flow powers AI chat for everyone in that org.
  - New `app_secrets` scope: `"org"` (alongside `"user"` and `"workspace"`).
  - `writeBuilderCredentials(email, creds, { orgId, role })` writes at `scope: "org"` when the connecting user is owner/admin of an active org. Plain members (or users in Personal mode) keep writing at `scope: "user"` so a teammate can never overwrite the org-shared connection. The Builder OAuth callback now passes `orgId`+`role` automatically — existing direct callers without options keep their previous user-scope behaviour.
  - `resolveBuilderCredential` and `resolveSecret` now check user scope first, then fall back to the active org's row. `${env.BUILDER_PRIVATE_KEY}` (deploy-managed mode) still wins over both, unchanged.
  - `deleteBuilderCredentials(email, { orgId, role })` mirrors the connect-side scope decision, so a Disconnect press undoes exactly what the same user's Connect press wrote — no orphaned org-shared rows for owners, no accidental org-wide tear-downs from a member's personal disconnect.
  - Helper `resolveCredentialWriteScope(email, orgId, role)` exposes the scope decision for any future credentials integration that wants the same default-to-org-when-admin behaviour.

  Migration: existing per-user Builder connections from before this change keep working for the connecter — but other org members won't auto-resolve to them. To promote a user-scope connection to org-shared, the owner/admin disconnects and reconnects once in the affected app.

- dca4f6d: Domain-based org join across the framework — three connected changes so a fresh signup whose email matches an existing org's `allowed_domain` lands inside that org without manual steps:
  - **Auto-join on signup.** New `autoJoinDomainMatchingOrgs(email)` helper, called from the Better Auth `user.create.after` hook. Anyone who signs up with an email whose domain matches `organizations.allowed_domain` is added to that org as a `member` immediately, and `active-org-id` is set to it (only when the user doesn't already have an active org from a pending invite). Idempotent and missing-table-safe.
  - **OrgSwitcher popover** now renders a "Join your team" section listing every domain-match org with a one-click Join button, for users who signed up before the org existed (or whose auto-join failed). Wires through `useJoinByDomain`.
  - **InvitationBanner** also renders domain-match orgs as a top-of-app prompt, so existing-but-not-yet-joined users see a clear CTA without needing to open the picker.

  The backend (`organizations.allowed_domain`, `getMyOrgHandler.domainMatches`, `joinByDomainHandler`, `useJoinByDomain`) was already in place — these changes wire it into the signup flow and the prominent UIs.

### Patch Changes

- dca4f6d: Improve agent chat setup and auth recovery by routing missing provider setup to Builder.io and surfacing hosted sign-in for authentication failures.
- dca4f6d: Replace native title hints on interactive controls with shadcn tooltips.
- dca4f6d: Resolve agent engine status against the active request user so per-user provider secrets are detected correctly.
- a1fef80: Add [dev-session] log when auto-binding email in CLI runner; fix TS narrowing in db-reset-dev-owner; remove redundant trim in zeroChangesHint.
- 117d476: Harden GitHub design-token imports with token-aware fetch helpers and keep persisted agent run diagnostics longer for reconnect investigation.
- dca4f6d: Keep agent chat auto-recovery alive across long runs that keep making progress.
- dca4f6d: Dedupe collaborative presence avatars by email and show collaborator emails on hover.
- dca4f6d: Smooth signup email verification handoff back into the app.

## 0.8.2

### Patch Changes

- 3424455: Fix `agent-native create` failing with "Unrecognized archive format" on freshly published versions. The CLI now tries the changesets per-package tag (`@agent-native/core@<version>`) first, falls back to the legacy `v<version>` tag, and finally to `main` — so it keeps working through the release-tag scheme shift introduced when the framework adopted changesets.
- 81005c4: Add an optional AgentPanel chat notice render slot.
- 81005c4: Export a reusable client theme initialization script helper.
- 81005c4: Avoid stale Vite prebundles for core source aliases in monorepo development.
- 81005c4: Initialize template light/dark classes before hydration and normalize legacy theme storage.

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- e3a8798: Recover agent chat runs automatically when streams time out, disconnect, or stay open without producing progress.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- e375642: Add `@agent-native/core/usage` subpath export for `getUsageSummary` so server-side consumers (Cloudflare Workers / Pages) can import it without hitting the curated browser entry. Switch dispatch's usage-metrics store to the new subpath, fixing the dispatch CF Pages build failure.

### Patch Changes

- bcb2069: Hide partial assistant text from transient agent-chat continuations while retaining it as continuation history.
  Recover agent chat streams that stay connected but stop producing progress events.

## 0.7.85

### Patch Changes

- 4e3631b: Add `publishConfig.provenance: true` so `pnpm publish` (called by `changeset publish` from the auto-publish workflow) requests an OIDC token from GitHub Actions and publishes via npm trusted publisher. Without this, `pnpm publish` looked for token-based auth and failed with `ENEEDAUTH`.

## 0.7.84

### Patch Changes

- a75a89c: In Builder.io's editor frame, `sendToAgentChat` now keeps content prompts self-targeted so the embedded app's own `AgentSidebar` receives them. Code requests still delegate to Builder via `builder.submitChat`. Drops the explicit `isInBuilderFrame()` branching from dispatch's home composer — the routing now lives in core.
- a75a89c: Add Dispatch workspace usage metrics and preserve app ids in token usage rows.
- a75a89c: Recommend Dispatch more clearly during workspace scaffolding and add a packaged Dispatch extension API for workspace-owned tabs.
- a75a89c: Add server-side 302 redirect from `/tools` and `/tools/:id` page routes to `/extensions/...` so existing bookmarks for the renamed primitive keep working. Honors `APP_BASE_PATH` for workspace deployments.
