## 0.7.4

### Patch Changes

- Release all public npm packages with a patch version bump.

## 0.7.3

### Patch Changes

- baedb60: Fetch the headless browser at launch instead of embedding it in every serverless function. `@agent-native/creative-context` now depends on `@sparticuz/chromium-min` (46KB) rather than `@sparticuz/chromium` (66.4MB), and passes a version-pinned pack URL to `executablePath()`. The hosted Builder Browser path is unchanged and still preferred; this only affects the local-launch fallback, which now downloads the pack once per container. Set `AGENT_NATIVE_CHROMIUM_PACK_URL` to serve the pack from your own mirror. Measured on slides: server function 126.0MB → 59.6MB, total upload 243.8MB → 111.0MB.

## 0.7.2

### Patch Changes

- Release all public npm packages with a patch version bump.

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- 10de7b9: Remove unused imports and unreachable declarations. Dispatch drops unused
  imports from its layout, transactional email pages, and MCP gateway;
  creative-context drops unused type imports and an unread `headingStyle`;
  recap-cli drops the `node:os` import and two unread locals; skills drops the
  unreferenced `maybeUpdateInstructions` helper; toolkit drops unused imports and
  an unread `REALTIME_VOICE_REQUEST_SOURCE`. No runtime behavior changes.
  `eslint/no-unused-vars` is now an oxlint error instead of a warning, so CI
  blocks new ones.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 39383b5: designs can be generated using creative context

## 0.6.6

### Patch Changes

- 4c7c289: Keep browser-rendered website style extraction working when the shared evaluator
  is bundled before it is serialized into Chromium.

## 0.6.5

### Patch Changes

- b3b4580: Normalize commenter access to the read-only creative-context role contract.

## 0.6.4

### Patch Changes

- 9204f85: Fix the Context tab's dropdown in the Share dialog rendering invisibly behind the host popover and dismissing the whole dialog on interaction. The select now matches the popover's nested-overlay z-index and is marked so `ShareButton` doesn't treat clicks inside it as outside clicks.

## 0.6.3

### Patch Changes

- 25f588e: Redirect legacy `/agent` management URLs to the canonical settings routes and preserve app-owned settings tabs.

## 0.6.2

### Patch Changes

- e177059: Restore the serverless Playwright fallback so production URL extraction can use packaged Chromium.

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- aa24c7e: Use the declared optional Playwright runtime through a literal import so Cloudflare deployments can apply their fail-closed browser stub.
- 9d8ae68: Run website brand extraction in an isolated real browser through the SSRF-safe network proxy, with serverless Chromium support and an explicit static fallback.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- abb0cf5: Add a shared browser-rendered website design-system extraction surface with computed visual tokens, component evidence, and bounded design.md summaries.

## 0.5.12

### Patch Changes

- 2765110: Avoid database migrations and recurring sweeps during durable background cold starts.

## 0.5.11

### Patch Changes

- c71d383: Include the shared creative-context and toolkit updates in the next package release.

## 0.5.10

### Patch Changes

- d6e7c5c: Stop a second Chromium from being downloaded alongside the one already on disk.

  First-party workspace packages now take Playwright from an exact catalog pin, so
  a caret cannot resolve forward to a release tied to a different Chromium
  revision. The two packages that declare Playwright as a published optional
  dependency — `@agent-native/creative-context` and `@agent-native/recap-cli` —
  deliberately keep a caret range instead: an exact range in a library stops a
  consumer who already has a different Playwright from deduping, which forces a
  nested copy and downloads exactly the second browser this change exists to
  avoid.

## 0.5.9

### Patch Changes

- f499dff: Add `@agent-native/core/vitest-config`, a base vitest config that caps a suite's
  worker pool so concurrent test runs no longer oversubscribe the CPU. Defaults to
  25% of cores; override with `VITEST_CONCURRENCY`. Every template and package
  config merges it in.

## 0.5.8

### Patch Changes

- c8a0bcf: Declare `@tanstack/react-query` as a peer/dev dependency so `tsc` can name its types under pnpm's isolated layout. Without it the package fails to build with TS2883 in a generated workspace, which breaks the root `postinstall` and therefore `pnpm install`.

## 0.5.7

### Patch Changes

- 8453025: Add manifest-driven feature ejection with dry-run planning, committed provenance, import rewrites, drift inspection, hash-gated restore, protected-runtime guidance, and complete first-party coverage guards.

## 0.5.6

### Patch Changes

- e53a34e: Extract reusable Postgres search and embedding primitives into Core while preserving Creative Context imports.
  The pgvector setup error now consistently says "Vector search" instead of the narrower "Visual search" wording.

## 0.5.5

### Patch Changes

- 6acaad0: Extract reusable Postgres search and embedding primitives into Core while preserving Creative Context imports.
  The pgvector setup error now consistently says "Vector search" instead of the narrower "Visual search" wording.

## 0.5.4

## 0.5.3

### Patch Changes

- b6d7f87: Move portable rich-editor, context presentation, and visual design controls into Toolkit while preserving Core compatibility re-exports, and add accurate side-effect metadata to capability packages.

## 0.5.2

### Patch Changes

- 915c940: Preserve stubbed optional package imports and package subpaths when bundling Cloudflare Pages workers.

## 0.5.1

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- a485fbe: Add the Creative Context package for importing, versioning, searching, and reusing workspace decks, designs, assets, websites, and content across creative apps.

  Expose reusable ingestion, prompt-context provider, and search utility seams from core for package-driven creative context.

  Includes bounded image-region cropping for durable localized creative-context fallbacks.

## 0.3.0
