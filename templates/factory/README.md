# Factory

Factory is the inspectable foundation for building agent factories: work goes
in one end, governed agent work and shipped changes come out the other, with
human intervention points you control. It can start with Slack feedback and
pull-request evidence, then grow to orchestrate product workflows such as
PRD -> design -> engineering -> release.

## What it does

- Polls a configured Slack channel and records new messages with thread and
  coverage metadata.
- Ingests read-only pull-request evidence from GitHub.
- Evaluates editable prompt rules with hard structured guards and stores every
  decision append-only.
- Lets a human correct a decision or tune a rule from the Factory UI or the
  generic Agent-Native Slack bot.
- Starts clear-bug work by tagging Builder in Slack or `@builderio-bot` on a
  GitHub issue, deduped by Factory item.
- Surfaces incomplete evidence and timeouts as explicit states rather than
  plausible success.

The current implementation is deliberately observe-first and shadow-only.
Sensitive work remains human-gated: auth/session/identity, credentials/vault,
migrations, payments, security, and publishable `packages/*` changes. Factory
does not silently auto-merge, assign, or claim a provider action succeeded
without a terminal record.

## Configure Slack

Set `WORKSPACE_OWNER_EMAIL` to an existing member of the Builder.io organization
that Dispatch uses. Factory does not need a separate organization: startup
finds that existing organization and seeds its organization-owned automations.
If Dispatch synced the vault into a different organization, set
`AGENT_VAULT_ORG_ID` to that existing org id instead of creating a new org.

Connect providers in Dispatch or in Settings -> Integrations. Factory resolves
Slack, GitHub, Sentry, and other supported provider credentials from
the shared workspace vault. Hosted Factory does not read provider keys from
deployment environment variables. Local development (`pnpm dev`) may
use `.env` Slack, GitHub, and Sentry tokens when no connection or vault row
exists. To migrate an existing deployment, add the provider
connection in the standard workspace integration surface, verify it, and then
remove the old deployment variables. Factory never stores keys per factory. All
apps that read shared `app_secrets` rows must use the same
`WORKSPACE_SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (or the workspace's existing shared
encryption fallback). Never copy raw tokens between apps or add a second
env-only read in a provider client.

### GitHub token permissions

Factory prefers the new Agent-Native GitHub App. Configure `GITHUB_APP_ID`,
`GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID`, and `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` together. The App
needs repository `Pull requests: Read and write`, `Issues: Read and write`,
and `Checks: Read`, plus organization `Members: Read` for governance. Hosted
Factory stores the private key in the shared vault and generates short-lived
installation tokens server-side. Do not send a static token or private key to
developers. During migration, an existing `GITHUB_TOKEN` remains supported
when no App keys are configured.

For Factory pull-request polling and babysitting, scope a fine-grained token to
the target repository and grant these repository permissions:

- `Pull requests: Read` for pull requests, reviews, comments, and changed files.
- `Issues: Read and write` for issue creation, reactions, and PR comments.
- `Checks: Read` for complete check-run evidence.

Factory governance also verifies organization membership, so it needs
`Members: Read` under organization permissions. If governance may post an
approval, it also needs `Pull requests: Read and write`.

GitHub's REST documentation lists `Checks: Read` for fine-grained tokens, but
the current token editor may not offer that permission. This is a known GitHub
limitation ([support discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/129512)).
Factory can fall back to `Actions: Read` for GitHub Actions workflow runs when
Checks access is unavailable, but that does not provide complete evidence for
non-Actions checks. Use a GitHub App with `Checks: Read` when complete check
coverage is required.

Factory's observer keeps **per-factory** source metadata — Slack channel,
repository, Sentry project, and related polling settings — for its normalized
queue adapters. Each factory has its own inbox, rules, automations, and activity.
Reusable agents and workspace credentials stay shared. Each factory's observation
settings live on its Settings tab in the factory detail view. That metadata is
not a credential or a per-factory
integration setup. GitHub issue polling defaults to hourly; Slack and
pull-request checks use shorter bounded cadences because those sources can need
faster feedback. Every poll preserves errors for reconciliation.

Factory agents can discover connected provider APIs with
`provider-api-catalog`, inspect their docs with `provider-api-docs`, and call
them through `provider-api-request`. Scheduled Factory runs also receive the
workspace's connected MCP tools, subject to the same workspace and request
scope gates. The three normalized pollers are compatibility adapters scoped by
`factoryId`, not the agent's capability limit.

The generic Slack bot is wired to Factory. Mention `@agent-native` in a feedback
thread to inspect the linked item, explain its decision, or tune a rule. The
bot replies with an inspectable Factory link when a human decision is required.

## Hosting

Production expects a direct PostgreSQL `DATABASE_URL`,
`WORKSPACE_OWNER_EMAIL`, and `FACTORY_PUBLIC_URL`. `AGENT_VAULT_ORG_ID` is
optional and is only needed when the deployment owner cannot reach the existing
Dispatch vault organization through membership. Factory automations use
workspace Slack and GitHub connections, or the org vault. They do not read Builder AI
services credentials, so this template is not locked to that vendor API.
Clear Sentry bugs become a GitHub issue in the factory repository, then tag
`@builderio-bot` the same way GitHub-issue dispatch does.

## Agents and agentic apps

Factory's top-level **Agents** sidebar tab is a shared workspace surface, not a
second registry. It reads mounted agentic apps and their editable Dispatch metadata,
then embeds Dispatch's reusable-agent manager for create, chat, import, and
folder-backed pack editing. A simple agent's profile lives at
`agents/<slug>.md`; its optional context, references, and private skills live
under `agents/<slug>/`. Use the folder import to bring in a Claude Project,
Cowork-style folder, or another text-based agent setup. The importer strips
credentials, hooks, shell commands, and local environment settings, and All-app
imports remain subject to Dispatch approval policy.

The page uses the same two-column library treatment for mounted apps and
reusable agents. Empty states keep creation actions in the content area, and
agent-specific secondary actions live behind each row's overflow menu.

When editing a factory flow, an agent step can bind to either a shared reusable
agent or a ready mounted agentic app from the same workspace database. The map
stores the selected target type and id, while the graph remains a reviewable
blueprint and does not silently change runtime routing.

Use **Build app** on an agent row when the agent needs a full workspace face.
The handoff carries the profile and every pack resource id into app creation;
the original agent remains reusable after the app is created. Mounted apps and
simple agents continue to use the same Dispatch actions, SQL resources, grants,
and application-state navigation.
