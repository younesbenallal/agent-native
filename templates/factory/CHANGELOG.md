# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to Chat are documented here. Open it any
time from the command menu (Cmd+K → "What's new").

## 2026-09-15

### Fixed

- Factory automation prompts version on save, show skill alignment separately, and stop duplicating injected blocks.

## 2026-09-14

### Improved

- Factory PR babysit uses a fair queue so re-queued pull requests are not starved, re-prioritizes open PRs when new review work arrives without a commit, and posts a v2 ping comment with per-thread disposition guidance.
- PR babysit now terminalizes merged and closed pull requests instead of re-listing them with "Seen before".

### Fixed

- Factory automations keep display names, Slack channels, and custom prompts through metadata repair, tab switches, and accidental clears.

## 2026-09-11

### Improved

- The Audit tab shows pull request numbers beside GitHub item titles, collapses long summaries with view more, and uses a clear Open thread button.
- GitHub inbox rows now show source, pull request number, and author on one line; Slack list rows resolve stored member names instead of raw ids, and Slack detail drops the duplicate heading once the thread loads.
- The Inbox list now shows separate Routing and Automation columns so babysit and Slack workflow progress is visible beside escalation status.
- PR babysitting now follows unresolved bot review feedback, defers while Builder is active, and shows recommendation, decision, and because on the Audit tab.

## 2026-09-10

### Improved

- Slack feedback marks clear bugs with 👀 again and requires that reaction before dispatching Builder.

### Fixed

- Factory automations keep display names, Slack channels, and author filters after poll runs and metadata repair.
- Factory PR babysitting now nudges Builder on Clips, Design, and Content pull requests instead of parking them as owner-managed.

## 2026-09-09

### Added

- A pull request that another request cannot unblock is now parked as stuck for a human to look at, rather than asked again on the next round.

### Improved

- Slack feedback jobs skip threads whose parent already has 👀 or 🤖, instead of tagging Builder again.

### Fixed

- Factory asks Builder to fix pull-request feedback once per round of work, instead of repeating the request each time GitHub recalculates whether the branch merges cleanly.
- Slack feedback keeps a claimed 👀/🤖 marker after polling, so those threads stay out of the review queue.
- Slack feedback no longer moves an already-started thread to needs-manual just because the parent already has 👀 or 🤖.

## 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- A second GitHub or Sentry automation no longer flips to Slack, and author filters, destinations, and Run now keep the job you actually saved.
- The automation editor now shows the saved values after you save, refuses to Run now while edits are unsaved, and says so when the automation you opened no longer exists.
- Factory automations keep Slack channels and display names after enable, disable, or schedule updates.
- Tagging @builderio-bot now works for factories whose GitHub repository comes from their automation instead of the factory's own field, and a dispatch that would post to a different repository than the factory is configured for is refused instead of posting there.
- GitHub polling now looks past a page of filtered-out authors or already-queued items to find the pull requests and issues you asked for, and a run that stopped early is recorded as incomplete with the reason named — more pages remained, the author filter skipped something, or the inbox limit was reached — instead of blaming the author filter for all three.
- PR governance now accepts the repository configured on the automation, so pull requests polled into the inbox are no longer rejected as out of scope when the factory's own repository field is empty.

## 2026-09-04

### Improved

- Inbox rows now show the GitHub pull request or issue title instead of the first line of its description, and the detail view gives every item a title, a single metadata line, and separated Reason, Evidence, and Log sections so Slack and GitHub items read the same way.

### Fixed

- Audit run rows now show the GitHub pull request or issue title in the collapsible header instead of the first line of its description, and Slack rows keep using the message text because those items have no title of their own.
- An automation's GitHub author filter now applies when items are polled instead of only when the inbox is read, so pull requests from other authors no longer fill the inbox and consume the item limit ahead of the authors you asked for.
- PR babysitting now accepts the repository configured on the automation, so pull requests that were polled into the inbox no longer sit unreviewed when the factory's own repository field is empty.
- The Automations tab still lists Factory jobs after their domain tag is missing.
- The built-in Factory map can be saved the first time without a stale-version error.
- Agent view-screen follows the Factory tab you are looking at when more than one is open.

## 2026-09-03

### Fixed

- An AI map save no longer renames the built-in Factory before it has been saved.
- Disabled Factory automations can clear a saved Slack channel, repository, or Sentry destination again.
- Slack channel IDs on a Factory automation no longer disappear after Run now.

## 2026-09-02

### Improved

- PR babysitting no longer fills an inbox item with the same “needs attention” line every few minutes. After it asks once, it steps out of the review queue until new human review feedback or a real merge conflict shows up.

### Fixed

- The Automations tab now has one create control, and it stays on screen when chat is open.
- Creating a factory or automation from chat now opens Inbox or Automations instead of rewriting the map.
- Factory automations stay listed, savable, runnable, and on schedule after a scheduler run updates their status.
- PR babysitting now asks Builder when a reviewer leaves body-only feedback, not only inline comments.
- PR babysitting no longer reopens a parked pull request when the author replies on an existing review thread.
- PR babysitting now reopens a parked pull request for a new reviewer body, and for a later merge conflict after an earlier one was cleared.

## 2026-09-01

### Fixed

- Deleting a factory now removes its automations, their run history, and polling cursors so leftover jobs cannot keep running.
- PR babysitting posts one ask to Builder and does not poke again when GitHub finishes mergeability or the bot pushes a commit.

## 2026-08-31

### Improved

- Audit runs now show what was added to the inbox, what the job worked on, and which actions it took.

### Fixed

- The connect banner now opens the workspace Dispatch host, and a vault outage no longer looks like a missing Slack connection.
- Creating or editing a Slack, GitHub, or Sentry job now shows a Dispatch connect banner above Run when that source is missing, and Create stays off until the channel, repo, or Sentry slugs are filled.
- Creating a Slack, GitHub, or Sentry job now works when the token is already in the vault, not only when Dispatch Integrations is connected.
- You can disable a Slack, GitHub, or Sentry job even when that connector is missing or the vault is down.
- Inbox and Audit stay usable when a connector lookup fails, and disabled job drafts can still set a destination.

## 2026-08-29

### Added

- New factories start with an empty Automations tab. Create one Slack, GitHub, or Sentry job at a time, with author ids and hard inbox and work limits.

### Improved

- Audit recent runs support automation and day filters, pagination, and smooth scroll when a run is selected.

### Changed

- `dispatch-factory-item` no longer always adds 👀. Pass optional `reaction` (for example `robot_face`) to mark the item source when Slack or GitHub can; omit it to add none.
- Factory now names its dispatch and PR review actions after what they do, so the agent can tell a write apart from a proposal.

## 2026-08-28

### Improved

- PR babysit runs now list each reviewed pull request and skip reason on the audit page.

### Fixed

- PR babysitting now reviews the next GitHub pull requests like Slack reviews the next messages, and only acts on authors named in that factory's prompt.
- PR babysitting now leaves out-of-scope pull requests out of the review window until the author changes, and audit runs count only new or changed PRs.
- PR babysitting now reads review comments and CI through the workspace GitHub connection, so watching Builder-bot pull requests no longer needs Builder AI services credentials.

### Changed

- Factory automations now use only the workspace Slack and GitHub connections, so this template does not need Builder AI services credentials and is not locked to that vendor API.

### Removed

- Inbox no longer has Approve and start. Clear bugs are started by tagging Builder in Slack or @builderio-bot on a GitHub issue.

## 2026-08-27

### Added

- Inbox can filter by date, status, risk, and source. Filters stay in the URL and clear when you leave Inbox.

### Improved

- Audit recent runs stack name, status, time, and outcome when the list is narrow, including when chat is open.
- Opening a factory now lands on Inbox, with signal, decision, and run counts above the list.
- GitHub source settings accept a repository page URL. Trailing slashes and extra path are stripped automatically.

### Fixed

- Long automation names in Audit recent runs wrap instead of overflowing the list.
- The Builder-bot PR babysitter can refresh open pull requests when it runs, instead of stopping before it looks at the queue.

### Changed

- Enabling Slack, GitHub, or Sentry polling no longer turns on the related automations. Enable those jobs from Automations when you want them to run.

## 2026-08-26

### Improved

- Inbox opens the full list first, then a full-screen thread with named people, standard emoji, and a back arrow.
- Inbox is a two-pane workbench with the Slack thread and item actions beside the reason, and Audit now labels runs clearly and shows the full message when a row is open.

## 2026-08-24

### Added

- You can permanently delete a user-created Factory from Settings after typing its name.

### Improved

- Workspace teammates can edit and run Factory jobs, not only the person who created them.

### Fixed

- Slack checking now works for factories created by someone other than the deploy owner.
- Slack polling now recognizes the Agent-Native bot when Slack reports its handle as @agentnative.

## 2026-08-21

### Improved

- Activity run history labels each run with the automation's display name instead of its full resource path.
- Create Factory and Settings now share the same labeled source cards, Enable polling toggles, and uncrowded scheduler health rows.
- Factory settings now show a sticky Save and Discard bar at the top as soon as a field changes, instead of a save button buried below the page.

### Fixed

- Automations remain visible while running, with live status updates in Automations and Activity.
- Factory Slack, GitHub, and Sentry automations now run for nested factories instead of failing before they can poll.

## 2026-08-11

### Fixed

- Chrome no longer offers to install Factory as a desktop app.

## 2026-08-10

### Improved

- Full-page chat now uses the available width up to 1000px for more comfortable prompts and responses.

## 2026-08-08

### Improved

- Scheduler health now stays in Settings until diagnostics are needed.

## 2026-08-07

### Added

- Factory can keep Builder bot pull requests moving by requesting fixes for review feedback, CI failures, and merge conflicts.

## 2026-08-05

### Improved

- Factory now keeps production automations running, shows scheduler health and run errors, and can email failure diagnostics.

## 2026-08-04

### Added

- Added organization-owned Factory automations for Slack bug triage, Builder handoffs, Sentry/GitHub intake, and governed PR approval.

### Improved

- Improved Factory automation editing with reliable tab navigation, a model picker that explains Auto, and map selection that no longer creates false unsaved changes.

## 2026-07-31

### Added

- Added Factory, an inspectable foundation for agent factories with Slack and pull-request evidence, shadow decisions, feedback, and guarded agent handoffs.

### Improved

- Clicking the Agent-Native logo now toggles the app sidebar.

## 2026-07-29

### Improved

- Sidebar footers now keep Feedback, Search, and Collapse together without a separate language shortcut.

## 2026-07-25

### Improved

- Settings navigation now keeps Manage agent as a dedicated linked destination at the bottom.

## 2026-07-24

## 2026-07-23

### Improved

- Full-page chat is better centered, with quieter chat history and a left-aligned New chat action.

## 2026-07-22

### Improved

- The sidebar footer now keeps Feedback and the collapse control on one compact row.
- Manage agent navigation now uses the connected-nodes icon.
- Recent chats now expand from a compact five-item list with New chat anchored at the bottom.

### Fixed

- Full-page chat keeps the active conversation when moving to and from the sidebar.

## 2026-07-17

### Fixed

- The agent chat sidebar stays closed until you open it or start a chat handoff.

## 2026-07-15
