const FEEDBACK_ALIGNMENT = `## Current review-latest-feedback contract

The repository's \`.agents/skills/review-latest-feedback/SKILL.md\` is
authoritative. Re-read it in the Builder worktree before acting. Its current
contract is evidence-first and reply-producing:

- Recheck answered clarifications and open In progress ownership before newer
  work. Keep the newest unhandled item as the cursor, read older duplicates
  into one verified cluster, and leave an auditable disposition for every
  inspected Slack, GitHub issue, and Sentry item.
- Read the complete parent/thread, reactions, attachments, linked artifacts,
  and newer follow-ups before asking anything or dispatching. An unavailable
  source is unavailable evidence, never a no-results result.
- Keep one specific unanswered clarification per thread. Re-read the whole
  thread when the requested detail is answered, try the fix first, and use the
  task-scoped clarification ledger with a stable scheduler identity for
  recurring rechecks. Do not claim scheduled coverage without stable durable
  state.
- Check the existing Slack reaction marker before any write. Preserve an
  existing marker; if reactions cannot be read, do not guess or add one. If
  the parent already has eyes 👀, call \`dispatch-factory-item\` with
  \`alreadyClaimed: true\` (\`clearBug\` may be omitted or \`false\`), omit
  reaction, and do not start Builder work.
- Classify \`risk\` and \`confidence\` on every item, including skips.
  \`dispatch-factory-item\` only tags Builder when \`clearBug\` is true,
  \`risk\` is low, and \`confidence\` is high; everything else is a skip
  regardless of how clear the bug looks.
- For a dispatch-eligible repo-owned Slack item (\`clearBug\` true, \`risk\`
  low, \`confidence\` high) with no existing eyes 👀, you MUST pass
  \`reaction: eyes\` 👀 on \`dispatch-factory-item\` — never dispatch without
  it. Every parent this run marks must later
  receive a verified @agent-native Fixed, In progress, or Clarification needed
  reply; a reaction, forward, generic acknowledgement, or another person's
  reply is not a disposition. Group only genuinely repeated symptoms and
  dispatch one Builder thread for the cluster.
- Choose the smallest owning seam: local regression for one symptom, shared
  contract for repeated cross-surface evidence, discovery/action wiring for a
  missing capability, and release/deployment diagnosis for source-versus-live
  mismatches. Do not turn one report into a global prompt rule.
- Keep source-tested, built, published/deployed, and observed-live evidence
  separate. Do not claim a fix, PR, reply, or deployment without confirmation
  from the relevant action or runtime evidence.

After classifying every processed item, call \`dispatch-factory-item\` so every
skip or dispatch is recorded: \`alreadyClaimed: true\` (\`clearBug\` may be
omitted or \`false\`) when the parent already has eyes 👀, otherwise
\`clearBug: true\` or \`false\`, \`risk\`, \`confidence\`, and a concise
evidence-grounded reason. Pass \`reaction: eyes\` only when \`clearBug\` is
true, \`risk\` is low, and \`confidence\` is high.`;

const PR_ALIGNMENT = `## Current review-prs contract

The repository's \`.agents/skills/review-prs/SKILL.md\` is authoritative.
Before selecting work, ignore drafts and ordinary pull requests with a
current-head, non-dismissed APPROVED review, including bot approvals; do not
inspect or recap those excluded items. Eligible Liam PRs with only older-head
approvals remain candidates so the current head can be approved. For every
remaining PR, read the complete title,
body, links, changed-file diff (including generated and migration files), all
review summaries/comments/replies, actual check conclusions, and ownership
boundary. Verify current BuilderIO organization membership through GitHub's
organization API - never infer it from a name, association, branch, email, or
bot label.

Never approve external or unverified authors. The internal-author exception
allows ordinary failed, pending, skipped, or unknown checks and ordinary
unresolved feedback for a verified BuilderIO member; record those exact states
and never call them clean. The ultra-scary gate always remains manual for auth,
permissions, tenant isolation, secrets, destructive data loss or migrations,
remote code execution, MCP iframe sandboxing, CSP, HTML sanitization, SSRF,
payments, deployment, or unexplained dependency and infrastructure risk. Active
credible safety findings in fresh review evidence remain blocking for every
author, including Liam.

For the exact \`liamdebeasi\` login and immutable GitHub user ID \`2721089\`, a
current BuilderIO membership check is still required. When the current,
non-draft PR has no current-head, non-dismissed approval, the Liam exception
allows approval across ordinary check, review-feedback, scope, and UX-owner
gates without authorizing a merge. It does not apply to ultra-scary changes or
changes to review/approval policy, agent-safety instructions, membership
verification, or CI/deployment security controls; those require independent
human review.

The verified owner exceptions are current and must be applied only after
membership and the ultra-scary assessment: Alice (\`3mdistal\`) for Content,
Nick (\`NKoech123\`) for Slides, Enzo (\`enzoames\`) for Factory-specific PRs,
and Sid (\`sidmohanty11\`) for Design. Alice and Nick may include supporting
shared framework/Desktop plumbing required by their app feature. For
BuilderIO/agent-native PRs, Shomix (shomix, GitHub user ID 100691266) may be
auto-approved across app and framework areas, including UX changes, refactors,
ordinary unresolved feedback, and failed or pending checks. Match both the login
and immutable GitHub author ID; do not rely on login alone. This exception never
applies to review/approval policy, agent-safety instructions, membership
verification, or CI/deployment security changes;
those require independent human review. The docs-only
exception applies to \`kapunahelewong\` and Wes (\`bwreid\`) only when every
changed file is documentation, localization, docs navigation/redirect, or a
docs-specific test. These exceptions cover ordinary UX/refactor/check/review
gates but never membership, external-author, or ultra-scary gates.

Approve only when the remaining standard evidence supports a clear,
repo-owned, narrow root-cause change with unambiguous scope. Approval is a
trust decision only - never auto-merge. Never claim ignored checks or feedback
are resolved, and record one concise disposition for every PR that entered the
evidence sweep.`;

const BABYSIT_ALIGNMENT = `## PR babysit contract

Follow the fixed poll → list → propose → babysit path only. Read
\`recommendation\` and \`because\` from propose-pr-babysit-status and match
the babysit decision unless the briefing clearly contradicts them.

Allowed decisions: ping, defer, already_asked, stuck. Unresolved bot review
threads count as work unless closed by reply, GitHub resolve, outdated status,
or a structured coverage comment. Factory-only duplicate detection ignores human
copies of the template comment. Defer while Builder is active within the 20-minute
quiet window. Mark stuck when bot errors after a ping, or Required — not fixing
on a thread, make another ask useless.

Do not review diffs, call govern-factory-pull-request, or use ad-hoc GitHub
tools. Never approve or merge.`;
