# factory - Development Guide

This guide is for development-mode agents editing this app's source code. For app operations and tools, see AGENTS.md.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** @agent-native/core + React Router v8 (framework mode)
- **Frontend:** React 19, Vite, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui
- **Routing:** File-based via `flatRoutes()` — SSR shell + client rendering
- **Backend:** Nitro (via @agent-native/core) — file-based API routing, server plugins, deploy-anywhere presets
- **State:** SQL-backed (SSE for real-time updates)

## Commands

- **Dev:** `pnpm dev` (Vite dev server with both React Router + Nitro plugins)
- **Build:** `pnpm build` (React Router build — client + SSR + Nitro server)
- **Start:** `node .output/server/index.mjs` (production)

## Framework Basics

**SSR-first framework, CSR-by-default content:** This app uses React Router v8 framework mode with `ssr: true`. But virtually every route renders only an SSR shell (loading spinner + meta tags). Normal app data fetching happens on the client via action hooks. Server-side data fetching is the exception — only used for public pages that need SEO/OG tags.

## Chat-First Shape

The `/` route is the app's primary chat surface. Keep it on
`AgentChatSurface` unless you are intentionally replacing the whole chat
experience. The left sidebar owns the durable thread list through
`useChatThreads`; app-specific screens can be added alongside it as nav items
when they become useful.

For a headless app that later needs UI, this template is the intended landing
zone: bring the existing actions over, keep their names stable, and let the chat
call them before adding extra screens. For a custom agent backend, keep the app
shell and swap the chat runtime with an `AgentChatRuntime` connector instead of
rewriting the composer/transcript UI.

## Adding a Page

Create a file in `app/routes/`. The filename determines the URL path:

```
app/routes/_index.tsx              → /
app/routes/settings.tsx            → /settings
app/routes/inbox.tsx               → /inbox
app/routes/inbox.$threadId.tsx     → /inbox/:threadId
app/routes/$id.tsx                 → /:id (dynamic param)
```

Each route file exports a default component, optional `meta()`, and optional `HydrateFallback()`:

```tsx
import MyPage from "@/pages/MyPage";

export function meta() {
  return [{ title: "My Page" }];
}

export function HydrateFallback() {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center h-screen">
      <div className="animate-spin rounded-full h-8 w-8 border-b-2 border-foreground" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default function MyPageRoute() {
  return <MyPage />;
}
```

**Do NOT fetch data server-side** in route loaders unless the page genuinely needs SEO/OG content. The standard pattern is: SSR renders the shell, client hydrates, and React reads/writes normal app data through actions with `useActionQuery` / `useActionMutation`.

## Adding App Data

Normal app data starts as an action, not a custom route. Add `actions/<verb>-<resource>.ts` with `defineAction`, mark reads with `http: { method: "GET" }`, and call reads/writes from React with `useActionQuery` / `useActionMutation` from `@agent-native/core/client`. This keeps the UI and agent on one contract and lets mutating actions refresh action-backed queries automatically.

## Adding a Route-Only Endpoint

Use `server/routes/api/` only for protocols that cannot be modeled as JSON actions: multipart uploads, streaming/SSE/WebSocket, webhooks, OAuth callbacks/redirects, public SEO/OG endpoints, or binary/static asset serving. Do not add `/api/*` routes for normal CRUD, data queries, or pass-through wrappers around actions; the action endpoint already exists at `/_agent-native/actions/:name`.

Each route-only endpoint still exports a default `defineEventHandler`, but keep shared app logic in actions or server libraries so agent and UI behavior do not fork.

## Adding a Server Plugin

Startup logic (auth, SSE, etc.) lives in `server/plugins/`. Use `defineNitroPlugin` from core:

```ts
import { defineNitroPlugin } from "@agent-native/core";

export default defineNitroPlugin(async (nitroApp) => {
  // Runs once at server startup
});
```

## Key Imports from `@agent-native/core`

| Import                                       | Purpose                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `defineNitroPlugin`                          | Define a server plugin (re-exported from Nitro)                            |
| `createDefaultSSEHandler`                    | Create SSE endpoint for DB change events (server)                          |
| `readAppState`, `writeAppState`              | Read/write application state (from `@agent-native/core/application-state`) |
| `readSetting`, `writeSetting`                | Read/write settings (from `@agent-native/core/settings`)                   |
| `defineEventHandler`, `readBody`, `getQuery` | H3 route handler utilities (re-exported)                                   |
| `sendToAgentChat`                            | Send messages to agent from UI (client-side)                               |
| `agentChat`                                  | Send messages to agent from scripts (server-side)                          |

## Adding an Action

Create `actions/<verb>-<resource>.ts` with `defineAction`. Run with `pnpm action <name> --id value`; React callers should use `useActionQuery` for GET actions and `useActionMutation` for mutating actions, not a matching `/api/*` wrapper.

**Sending to agent chat from UI:**

```ts
import { sendToAgentChat } from "@agent-native/core/client";
sendToAgentChat({
  message: "Generate something",
  context: "...",
  submit: true,
});
```

**Sending to agent chat from scripts:**

```ts
import { agentChat } from "@agent-native/core";
agentChat.submit("Generate something");
```

## Database & Environment Variables

Local development uses PGlite at `data/pglite`. For production and shared environments, set `DATABASE_URL` to a persistent hosted PostgreSQL database.

Real credential values belong only in local `.env` files, deployment configuration, or registered secrets/settings UI. Never commit, document, log, return, paste, or include real keys, tokens, webhook URLs, signing secrets, or private data in examples; use empty values or obvious placeholders.

When adding app data, define tables with `@agent-native/core/db/schema` helpers and use Drizzle's query builder for reads/writes. Keep SQL PostgreSQL-compatible and reserve raw SQL for additive migrations, health checks, or carefully scoped maintenance.

| Variable        | Required                     | Description                                                                   |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`  | Production yes, local dev no | PostgreSQL or PGlite database URL (local dev default: `pglite:./data/pglite`) |
| `AUTH_DISABLED` | Optional                     | Set to `true` or `1` to skip login/signup (local dev/preview only)            |

## Extensions (Framework Feature)

The framework provides **Extensions** — mini sandboxed Alpine.js apps that run inside iframes. Extensions let users (or the agent) create interactive widgets, dashboards, and utilities without modifying the app's source code. They appear in the sidebar under an "Extensions" section. (Distinct from LLM tools — the function-calling primitives the agent invokes.)

- **Creating extensions**: Via the sidebar "+" button, agent chat, or `POST /_agent-native/extensions`
- **API calls**: Extensions use `extensionFetch()` (legacy alias `toolFetch`) which proxies requests through the server with `${keys.NAME}` secret injection
- **Styling**: Extensions inherit the main app's Tailwind v4 theme automatically
- **Sharing**: Private by default, shareable with org or specific users (same model as other ownable resources)
- **Security**: Iframe sandbox + CSP + SSRF protection on the proxy

See the `extensions` skill in `.agents/skills/extensions/SKILL.md` for full implementation details.
