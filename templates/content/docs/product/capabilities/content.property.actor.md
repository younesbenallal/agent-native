# Actor properties

## Why this exists

Collaboration loses accountability when automation and agents are flattened into a generic service identity. People need to distinguish who first created a record from who most recently changed it and how that change arrived.

## Example workflow

A coordinator creates a request, automation enriches it, and an agent edits status; Created by stays coordinator while Last edited by names the agent.

## Product contract

- Actor values identify the actual human, agent, automation, or integration that committed the change.
- Creation sets Created by once; later committed changes update Last edited by without overwriting provenance.
- Denied, imported, or unavailable actor identity is represented honestly and does not collapse into a false personal attribution.

## Boundaries and non-goals

- Committed events own mutation attribution and origin; Actor Properties project that record into stable created/last-edited fields.
- Actor fields are not a permissions mechanism and do not fabricate a current-person identity when provenance is unresolved.

## Acceptance stories

### Keep creation provenance

Given imported work is later edited, when a person commits the change, then Created by remains imported origin.

### Admit unknown identity

Given legacy resolution fails, when the actor Property renders, then the actor field says unresolved rather than current viewer.

## Current evidence

`server/db/schema.ts` stores nullable Page creator and last-editor IDs. `actions/create-document.ts`, the single and bulk duplicate actions, `update-document.ts`, and `edit-document.ts` set request actors at their canonical transaction boundaries. `actions/list-content-trash.ts` projects those fields only after access scoping and resolves profile names in one bounded batch. Focused database tests cover canonical creation, duplication, later edits, nullable legacy provenance, access isolation, filtering, and stable pagination. This is a Page/Trash substrate only: it does not yet identify typed agent, automation, and integration actors through committed Events, so the Capability remains `approved_shape`.

## Proof plan

1. Exercise person/agent/automation/integration/import/restore.
2. Render access-aware actor and unresolved states.
3. Export/import without identity leakage.
4. Compare receipts and displayed actor.

## Open questions

Actor card versus text renderer remains open.
