# Mermaid diagrams

## Why this exists

A diagram should remain editable, portable source rather than becoming a picture that only one editor understands. Authors also need an honest fallback when a renderer does not support the diagram they wrote.

## Example workflow

Noor uses `/Diagram (Mermaid)`, edits its ordinary Code source, and exports a diagram that either renders faithfully or retains source and error.

## Product contract

- Mermaid is a Code language plus built-in renderer, not a Custom Block or a separate diagram datastore.
- The renderer may prefer an Agent-Native style but falls back to faithful Mermaid; errors preserve source and diagnostics.
- Public and exported documents never execute source and use a pinned static rendering or readable source fallback.

## Boundaries and non-goals

- `content.author.code` owns source and optional runtime behavior; Mermaid owns a compatible built-in renderer for `language = mermaid`.
- Mermaid is not a Custom Block, graph database, Canvas replacement, or a license to execute diagram source for viewers.

## Acceptance stories

### Preserve Code identity

Given an imported fenced Mermaid file, when re-exported, then it remains `language = mermaid` Code, not a Custom Block.

### Try compatible fallbacks

Given preferred styling fails, when rendering, then Mermaid fallback runs before source/error display.

## Current evidence

`app/blocks/contentBlockRegistry.tsx` is the Mermaid donor; `app/components/editor/extensions/CodeBlockNode.tsx` supplies Code identity. Fence mapping, SSR, accessibility, and export remain gaps.

## Proof plan

1. Create/import Mermaid blocks and verify fences/captions.
2. Test preferred, Mermaid, and double-failure paths.
3. Verify sanitizer, theme, accessibility, SSR, and static export.
4. Confirm no Custom Block catalog entry.

## Open questions

Renderer Auto versus explicit preference remains open.
