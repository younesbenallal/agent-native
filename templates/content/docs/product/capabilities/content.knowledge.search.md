# Search

## Why this exists

Search is how a system remembers aloud. It must be quick without ever pronouncing information a viewer may not read.

## Example workflow

A contributor searches a phrase, opens an indexed Page snippet, filters to a connected Source, and sees that one result is stale rather than treating it as current.

## Product contract

Search performs indexed lexical retrieval first across eligible objects, returns access-scoped snippets and highlights with source and freshness, and shares ranking semantics between people and agents.

## Boundaries and non-goals

Visibility closure owns authorization. This is not semantic-answer generation, a source-truth override, or a leakage-prone global index.

## Acceptance stories

### Suppress a private matching title

Given a private matching Page, when a viewer searches its title and body, then no result, highlight, count, or ranking inference exposes it.

### Label a stale connected result

Given a stale connected Source result, when it appears, then its freshness state is visible and opening it follows the Source policy.

## Current evidence

Existing search paths are in progress donor substrate, but complete indexed, freshness, and agent-parity proof is incomplete. This Capability remains `in_progress`.

The command picker uses the shared paginated search Action, with title-only,
document-type and modified-date predicates applied before pagination. Parent
context is independently access-scoped. The query supports a bounded
Google-style operator set: quoted "exact phrases", `-excludedTerm`,
uppercase `OR` between terms, `intitle:term`, and implicit AND across bare
words; `%`, `_`, and `*` stay literal, and an all-workspaces scope option
omits the space filter while keeping server-side access scoping. Search ranks
the complete authorized match set before pagination. Exact and contiguous
partial titles form protected tiers above title-word, description, and body
matches; modification time only breaks otherwise equal results. Snippet windows
prefer context containing more positive terms. Focused tests cover later pages,
private-parent suppression, hidden-result counts, title tiers, useful snippets,
type filters, and each operator. A 10,000-document PGlite benchmark covers the
current warm-query budget. This is bounded lexical search substrate, not proof
of indexed retrieval across every Source, authoritative author filtering,
freshness ranking, or policy-governed global search.

Local browser verification of the command picker covered 27 authorized matches
across two result pages, equal-title parent context, keyboard opening, title/body
and type/date filters, explicit request failure and retry. Pagination and retry
return focus to the search input. A reversible composition with the companion
sidebar controls change verified collapsed Search and the 390px mobile drawer:
the picker and filters remain visible above the drawer, Escape returns to Search,
and opening a result closes the drawer. This composed proof depends on that
companion's entry wiring and shared CommandMenu layer fix; it does not certify
screen-reader output or broader cross-context retrieval policy.

## Proof plan

1. Index titles, bodies, rows, and Sources; test lexical queries, snippets, highlights, and pages.
2. Verify private-match suppression, human/agent ranking, freshness, provenance, and opening.
3. Exercise stale indexes, source refresh, reload, keyboard traversal, and result summaries.

## Open questions

The first ranking signals beyond lexical relevance need design.
