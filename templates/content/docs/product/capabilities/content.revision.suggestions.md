# Suggestions

## Why this exists

People and agents need room to offer work before it becomes canonical. A suggestion is a real authored proposal, not an ephemeral chat message or a secret second document.

## Example workflow

An agent proposes edits to an article and its metadata. The proposal remains pending as one authored Revision. The editor accepts stronger passages, rejects an incorrect Property change, leaves another suggestion pending, and can later see every decision in History.

## Product contract

- A Suggestion is a pending logical Revision with stable identity, author, authority/origin, time, targets, observed basis, typed change set, and disposition.
- Human and agent suggestions use one model; neither receives a private document or review path.
- Pending suggestions do not mutate canonical target state until authorized acceptance.
- Author editing follows an explicit time/permission policy and preserves visible history rather than erasing the proposal.
- Acceptance, rejection, deferment, supersession, conflict, and expiry are durable Events/History states.
- A stale target exposes rebase, refresh, or conflict behavior; it never silently applies to a moved target.

## Boundaries and non-goals

- Suggestions are not every Event, snapshot, or named Page Version.
- This record does not define filtered-set review or AI summaries.
- A pending suggestion does not widen access to its target or its underlying evidence.

## Acceptance stories

### Keep a proposal pending until review

Given an agent proposes a Block and Property change, when the proposal is created, then the canonical Page is unchanged and the editor can inspect one attributable pending Revision in place.

### Handle a moved target without overwrite

Given an editor changes a target after a suggestion's observed basis, when another reviewer accepts the suggestion, then Content presents a rebase, refresh, or conflict state and does not silently overwrite the newer canonical change.

## Current evidence

Current document snapshots and source-review machinery provide useful proposed-change donors. The repository does not yet prove generic authored pending Revisions, typed suggestion review, or conflict semantics across Content; this remains `approved_shape`.

The document-markdown slice now supports amendments through the shared `update-resource-suggestion` Action. The author must still have commenter access, the suggestion must remain pending, and its canonical basis and observed proposal revision must match. An amendment preserves the suggestion and discussion identities and records its before/after state in durable history without writing canonical content. Acceptance checks the viewed proposal revision so an author cannot change what a reviewer accepts after the reviewer has read it. The editor's reopen path is limited to the author's own human-authored, single-operation markdown suggestions.

Focused core amendment and Content adapter tests cover author/access checks, stale basis and proposal revisions, amendment/decision races, exact retry receipts, additive schema preservation, and unchanged canonical content. These checks do not establish generic typed Revision support, a user-visible amendment-history viewer, Notifications, or deployment acceptance.

Agents propose body suggestions through `suggest-document-edit` (Content action, `mcpTool` with a fully typed agent input schema): the agent supplies the document id, its `baseRevision` from `get-document`, an `idempotencyKey`, and exact find/replace text; the action resolves the match, builds the full before/after Markdown payload and the contextual anchor, and delegates to `create-resource-suggestion` so access, idempotent replay, threads, and notifications stay in one path. Malformed or stale calls fail with errors that name the fix (`SUGGESTION_FIND_NOT_FOUND`, `SUGGESTION_FIND_AMBIGUOUS`, `SUGGESTION_EDIT_PROTOCOL_REQUIRED`). The generic action's Markdown payload errors also state the expected object shape. Focused Content db tests cover creation, idempotent replay, missing and ambiguous finds, the external-caller protocol, and proposals on ordinary database-item Pages. Acceptance tests cover primary Blocks-field reconciliation across multiple collection memberships.

## Proof plan

1. Create, edit, submit, accept, reject, defer, supersede, and expire human and agent suggestions.
2. Test author windows, target permissions, access changes, Notifications, History, and recovery.
3. Race concurrent author edits, reviewer decisions, target edits, and retries.
4. Verify typed body/Property/Block rendering through UI and shared Actions.

## Open questions

The document-markdown author edit window is pending status plus current commenter access and an unchanged basis. Author editing across other target types, the amendment-history presentation, and rebase UX remain open. Pending identity, durable disposition, and no-silent-overwrite behavior are settled.
