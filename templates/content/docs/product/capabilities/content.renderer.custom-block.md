# Custom Blocks

## Why this exists

Reusable components must be discoverable and governable without becoming opaque bundles of code with accidental powers. The source of a component and the people allowed to reuse it are separate questions that must remain visible.

## Example workflow

An operations lead approves a repository-backed status card, inserts it from slash search, binds typed props, and gets adapter fallback instead of repository execution.

## Product contract

- Ownership scope governs reuse and approval; origin says where source truth lives, and the axes remain independent.
- Every entry has stable identity plus name, description, aliases, category, compatibility, icon, ownership, origin, and optional preview metadata. Slash insertion searches that contract; `@` remains for references and expressions.
- Props are optional. A block may be a fixed renderer with no inputs or expose typed inputs that the editor validates and binds explicitly.
- Content-managed bundles receive explicit props only in a strict sandbox; source-backed code needs a trusted adapter renderer or visible fallback.
- **Save as Custom Block** promotes a page-owned Artifact into a new catalog entry while preserving provenance. Copying an Artifact alone never enrolls it in the catalog.
- An Extension is a more capable application with grants and is never silently presented as a Custom Block.
- Public or static output uses a deterministic declared fallback and never executes merely because the Custom Block is visible.

## Boundaries and non-goals

- Source adapters own repository/provider synchronization; the Custom Block catalog owns reusable renderer identity, governance, origin metadata, and typed props.
- Artifact Blocks own one-off page-local HTML/CSS/JS and promotion. Built-in Blocks may implement the same discovery contract but do not masquerade as editable Custom Blocks.
- Custom Blocks are renderers, not Extensions: they do not acquire arbitrary Actions, ambient Content data, filesystem, parent DOM, secrets, cookies, or network authority.

## Acceptance stories

### Keep axes independent

Given a personal repository-backed block is shared, when scope changes, then repository origin remains unchanged.

### Do not disguise Extensions

Given an Extension has grants, when embedded, then it remains a visible Extension embed.

### Promote one Artifact deliberately

Given a page-owned Artifact has no catalog record, when its owner chooses Save as Custom Block, then Content creates one governed catalog identity with provenance and leaves ordinary copied Artifacts local.

## Current evidence

`app/components/editor/extensions/LocalMdxComponentNode.tsx`, `actions/list-local-component-files.ts`, `actions/write-local-component-file.ts`, and `app/blocks/contentBlockRegistry.tsx` are donors, not a hosted catalog. `app/components/editor/registrySlashItems.ts` separately curates which built-in renderers appear in slash discovery; registry membership alone does not make a renderer an authoring command. Builder source formats remain registered for existing content but are hidden from insertion until new blocks can receive valid source sidecars.

## Proof plan

1. Test managed, repository, and provider origins with no props, typed props, local aliases, and origin-preserving scope changes.
2. Test slash discovery and insertion across compatibility, permissions, preview, validation, unavailable origin, Versions, and provenance.
3. Deny ambient data, Actions, cookies, secrets, DOM, filesystem, and network; verify trusted adapter fallback without executing repository code in the sandbox.
4. Promote a one-off Artifact, copy it without promotion, export every origin deterministically, and distinguish built-ins and Extensions.

## Open questions

Catalog version/update policy and the first trusted-adapter eligibility rules still need a dedicated Shape. Network grants remain Extension territory rather than a Custom Block option.
