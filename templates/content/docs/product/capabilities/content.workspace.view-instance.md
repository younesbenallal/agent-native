# View instances

## Why this exists

Two windows can hold two questions about one Page. They should not create two Pages in
order to do it.

## Example workflow

An editor opens one Collection in a Table tab and a Timeline pane, changes a record in the
Table, and sees the Timeline reconcile while its range and focus remain independent.

## Product contract

- A View instance references a canonical object plus instance-local presentation, focus, and selection state.
- Tabs, panes, embeds, and later windows may show the same object without duplicating it.
- Canonical mutations, permissions, and deletion reconcile across instances through shared Actions and state sync.
- Lazy rendering bounds resource use without falsely treating an unmounted instance as closed or complete.

## Boundaries and non-goals

Working set owns instance persistence. A View instance is not a Page, Collection, Query,
permission boundary, or a fork of data.

## Acceptance stories

### Compare two presentations

Given a Collection open in a Table and Timeline instance, when a person changes Timeline
range, then Table configuration is unchanged while both retain the same canonical records.

### Reconcile one edit

Given two authorized instances of one record, when an editor changes it through one, then
the other reflects the canonical result without duplicate history or stale copy.

## Current evidence

Existing tabs or embeds are donor substrate only; no complete multi-instance contract is
proven. This Capability remains `approved_shape`.

## Proof plan

1. Test two-instance focus, presentation, selection, close, persistence, and lazy rendering.
2. Verify mutations, permission changes, deletion, errors, and recovery across instances.
3. Exercise keyboard, assistive technology, reload, embed, and agent-context workflows.

## Open questions

Cross-window synchronization and focus-transfer policy need separate implementation design.
