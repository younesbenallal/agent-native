# Multi-object Templates

## Why this exists

A working system spans more than one page, yet copying a folder of loose objects loses the relationships that make it work. Teams need a reusable starting graph that becomes genuinely theirs after installation.

## Example workflow

Kai installs a research Template graph, edits its new collection and view freely, and traces the owned instance to the source version.

## Product contract

- Templates fork; they do not possess the instance or create a live hidden copy.
- Instantiation remaps graph-local identities while preserving declared external references and access checks.
- The instance remains ordinary editable Content with provenance to the source Template and version used.

## Boundaries and non-goals

- Pages, Collections, Views, Properties, Rules, Expressions, and Blocks remain the canonical objects; the Template records their portable graph and provenance.
- Templates fork rather than possess; they do not create a parallel datastore, fixed singleton, or hidden live synchronization channel.

## Acceptance stories

### Fork, do not possess

Given two teams adopt the Template, when one team edits its local collection, then one local collection edit does not affect the other or source.

### Remap internal identity

Given internal links and an external reference, when the graph instantiates, then new links point locally and external reference remains declared/access-checked.

## Current evidence

`docs/product/architecture.md` defines graph snapshots; Page, Collection, and Reference records are donors, not graph serialization/instance recovery.

## Proof plan

1. Serialize ordinary objects, rules, expressions, bodies, and references.
2. Instantiate twice and verify independent IDs/provenance/access.
3. Test unavailable dependencies and recovery without half graphs.
4. Round-trip portable graph export/import.

## Open questions

All-or-nothing versus staged recovery needs root judgment.
