# Organization teams

## Why this exists

One Team membership truth prevents each app from growing a conflicting roster. Content may manage it without becoming a second identity provider.

## Example workflow

An organization administrator creates a Team in Content, assigns members under the existing organization, and uses it in a Page access rule. Another app reads the same canonical Team membership.

## Product contract

Content manages the framework-wide Team representation through canonical organization identity and membership services. Team changes use authorized Actions, audit history, and propagate to compatible access and workflow surfaces.

## Boundaries and non-goals

Multi-scope and page/collection access own context and authorization. This is not an app-local roster, automatic organization creation, or an alternate identity provider.

## Acceptance stories

### Deny an app-local roster edit

Given a non-administrator, when they try to change Team membership, then the canonical Action denies it and no app-local fallback is created.

### Propagate a canonical Team change

Given a Team is used in a Page rule, when an authorized administrator changes membership, then compatible consumers observe the canonical membership with attributable audit history.

## Current evidence

No complete framework-wide Team management and consumer-consistency proof is recorded. This Capability remains `approved_shape`.

## Proof plan

1. Test canonical Team membership changes for administrators and non-administrators.
2. Verify consumer reads, access rules, audit records, propagation, and no local fallback.
3. Exercise revocation, sync conflict, organization boundaries, and accessible management.

## Open questions

The organization-admin delegation and membership-sync conflict policy need design.
