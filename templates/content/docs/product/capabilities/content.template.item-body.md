# Collection item Templates

## Why this exists

One collection can hold several kinds of work, and a blank page makes each new record start from nothing. Authors need a chosen starting body that carries the new item's actual context without rewriting existing records.

## Example workflow

Kai creates a request from a Bug report body Template; its embedded view binds the new record and later default changes affect only future rows.

## Product contract

- Each body template is an ordinary graph-backed snapshot associated with the Collection, not a parallel content type.
- Creation applies the chosen template and defaults once within a successful transaction; dynamic views bind the newly created record context.
- Changing the collection default affects future creation only and never overwrites existing item bodies.

## Boundaries and non-goals

- `content.template.graph` owns template snapshot identity and `content.object.blocks-field` owns the item body; this record owns Collection-specific choice and creation context.
- Item Templates do not rewrite existing bodies when a default changes or create a hidden global-current-page binding.

## Acceptance stories

### Keep existing bodies

Given default body changes, when an existing item opens, then existing item bodies remain unchanged.

### Bind current item explicitly

Given an embedded view, when the item Template creates a record, then it uses declared new-item context, not hidden global page state.

## Current evidence

`actions/create-document.ts` and `app/components/editor/DocumentBlockFields.tsx` are donors; per-collection variants are absent.

## Proof plan

1. Create variants, choose default, test every creation route.
2. Apply defaults/current-record binding in one transaction.
3. Change defaults and verify future-only behavior.
4. Test missing context/incompatible view/failed creation.

## Open questions

Context-sensitive default selection beyond one explicit default remains open.
