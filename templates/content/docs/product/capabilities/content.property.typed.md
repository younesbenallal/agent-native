# Typed Properties

## Why this exists

A field label alone cannot tell a collection, export, or agent what a value means. Without durable types, dates become text and missing access becomes an innocent blank, quietly corrupting later work.

## Example workflow

Dara adds a place field, describes it, and sees the same typed value in property panel, collection view, and export.

## Product contract

- Stored values and computed results both declare exact output types; presentation is a renderer choice, not a hidden data conversion.
- Descriptions and typed semantics are available to people, agents, queries, validation, and export.
- Unknown, invalid, absent, and unreadable values remain distinct.

## Boundaries and non-goals

- `content.property.constraints` owns validation/default behavior and `content.expression.language` owns computed semantics; Typed Properties own declared value/output types.
- A renderer may change presentation but cannot change stored meaning or coerce denied/invalid/absent states into a normal value.

## Acceptance stories

### Keep computed type

Given a date formula, when sorted/rendered/exported, then each consumer gets a declared date.

### Do not coerce absence

Given unreadable relation and blank text, then renderers keep them distinct.

## Current evidence

`shared/properties.ts`, `actions/configure-document-property.ts`, and `app/components/editor/DocumentProperties.tsx` are donors; formula output types are not durable general declarations.

## Proof plan

1. Create/query/render/export stored and computed types.
2. Propagate descriptions to UI/actions/agents/serialization.
3. Test absent, invalid, unreadable, unsupported values.
4. Compare UI/action validation.

## Open questions

Computed output taxonomy needs root judgment.
