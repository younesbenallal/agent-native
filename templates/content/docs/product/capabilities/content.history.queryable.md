# History

## Why this exists

Collaboration needs an exhaustive place to ask what happened and recover from it. A friendly timeline can summarize, but it cannot quietly become the only evidence.

## Example workflow

An editor filters a Page's History to one agent run, expands its logical Revision into atomic Events, compares a changed Property and Block in their ordinary renderers, then restores only the authorized field.

## Product contract

- History is an access-scoped projection over committed Events, logical Revisions, recovery snapshots, and execution receipts.
- It supports filtering, grouping, sorting, stable links, and typed comparison in the normal Page/Collection renderer.
- Events are atomic facts; Revisions are causal review units; snapshots are recovery mechanics; named Versions are deliberate alternatives. History preserves those distinctions.
- Recovery invokes shared Actions and creates attributable new change rather than rewriting the past.
- Inaccessible history is denial or omission according to access context, never a successful empty timeline.

## Boundaries and non-goals

- Discussion is a curated collaboration projection, not the exhaustive recovery authority.
- History does not decide suggestion review disposition or Page Version promotion.
- It does not require every low-level persistence operation to be user-visible.

## Acceptance stories

### Compare a causal Revision in place

Given an agent Revision containing Block and Property changes, when an editor opens it in History, then they can inspect grouped Events and typed diffs in the ordinary surface without losing actor or causal context.

### Recover without leaking another Version

Given a person can read a Revision but lacks authority to edit a narrower Version, when they choose restore, then it is denied and the current content remains unchanged.

## Current evidence

Current document versions, restore actions, and editor history UI demonstrate snapshot-oriented substrate. They do not prove access-scoped Event/Revision queryability, typed diffs, or complete recovery semantics; this remains `approved_shape`.

Page history groups title/body recovery checkpoints by an explicit human editor session, agent run, or operation. Human sessions end on navigation, reload, restore, or five minutes of inactivity; separate tabs have separate identities. Grouping organizes the list without turning each autosave into a top-level entry. Metadata pagination and selected-checkpoint reads keep older recovery states reachable without loading every body. Restore prepares against the current document revision and preserves the displaced title/body in the same transaction as replacement.

This Page recovery surface is narrower than the capability above: it does not supply cross-object Event queries, typed diffs, selective field recovery, or named Page Versions. Independent acceptance of those contracts remains required before changing the capability state.

Page recovery replays serialized title/body content, including references. Inline collections omitted by the restored body follow ordinary save removal semantics; restoring an older reference does not recover a separately deleted collection object or its data.

Linked local files keep their file as the source of truth. Their checkpoints remain readable, but this SQL restore action rejects replacement until a revision-guarded source write and history reconciliation protocol is available; changing only the SQL mirror must never be reported as restoring the file.

Trash now adds a narrower recovery browser with an authorized, read-only Page-body preview and persisted purge receipts/outcomes. The preview is currently body-focused: it does not expose full typed Properties, comments, or checkpoint History. Purge operation records are deletion evidence, not the access-scoped cross-object Event/Revision query model required by this capability.

## Proof plan

1. Query and compare Events, Revisions, snapshots, and receipts across Page, Collection, source, and agent work.
2. Test filters, grouping, sort, links, pagination, access changes, and private data closure.
3. Restore fields and whole states under conflict, undo, and concurrent editing.
4. Verify UI and Actions with keyboard and assistive-technology paths.

## Open questions

Retention, compaction, and default grouping are implementation choices as long as authorized history stays attributable and recoverable.
