# Shared Form engine

## Why this exists

A question should not become less trustworthy because it appears in an embed instead of a Form View. One submission contract keeps duplicate and invalid input honest.

## Example workflow

A requester submits an intake Form from an embed. The same schema validates it as the internal Form View, rejects a duplicate idempotency key, and creates one canonical record with an Event.

## Product contract

Form schemas define typed fields, validation, permission, submission target, idempotency, and receipts. Content Form Views, Agent-Native Forms, and agents call one submission Action.

## Boundaries and non-goals

Property constraints own field rules and Events own committed receipts. This is not a second forms datastore, raw endpoint bypass, or a promise that every form is public.

## Acceptance stories

### Return the original receipt on retry

Given the same submission is retried, when the idempotency key matches, then Content returns the original receipt and creates no duplicate record.

### Reject a hidden field from an embed

Given an unauthorized field value, when it is submitted from an embed or agent, then shared validation denies it with the same typed failure.

## Current evidence

No complete shared schema, idempotency, cross-surface permission, and recovery proof is recorded. This Capability remains `approved_shape`.

## Proof plan

1. Define one schema and submit it from Form Views, embeds, and agents.
2. Test validation, permissions, idempotency, receipts, retries, and target availability.
3. Run keyboard and screen-reader completion flows with rejected-field recovery.

## Open questions

Public-form identity and draft-save policy need design.
