# Row-level privacy

## Why this exists

A shared tracker sometimes contains a draft, personnel matter, or private alternative. The item should remain in the governed workflow without becoming ambiently discoverable.

## Example workflow

A team keeps a hiring Collection visible to managers. One candidate row is restricted to a smaller panel. The panel can work with the row; other managers see neither its fields nor its contribution to counts.

## Product contract

- A Collection supplies ordinary default access; a Page/row may narrow that visibility through explicit principals.
- Narrower row access applies before list, View, Query, relation traversal, search, aggregate, export, agent context, and source operations.
- An authorized direct link opens the Page; an unauthorized known direct link returns an honest generic denial.
- Row privacy does not make a Page's identity dependent on a Collection or grant access through another membership.
- All mutations use the shared Action decision and record attributable history.

## Boundaries and non-goals

- Row privacy narrows inherited access; it does not widen a Page beyond allowed policy.
- It does not define public publishing or named-Version access, which have their own boundaries.
- Hiding a View column is presentation, not row privacy.

## Acceptance stories

### Hide a restricted row from collection work

Given one private row in a shared Collection, when an unauthorized member opens a View, searches, groups, or exports it, then the row and its values do not appear or affect derived output.

### Keep direct access honest

Given an unauthorized person knows the private row's URL, when they open it or invoke an Action, then access is denied without reporting a successful empty Page or exposing its title.

## Current evidence

The repository has ownable records and access-aware Content surfaces, providing substrate. It does not yet prove complete per-row principals across every derived path and source policy, so the capability remains `approved_shape`.

## Proof plan

1. Exercise inheritance, restriction, principal changes, and recovery through UI and Actions.
2. Re-run Views, Queries, search, relationships, exports, agents, and aggregates for each role.
3. Test source sync/write-back and access changes during pending work.
4. Verify trash, restore, audit/history, and generic denial behavior.

## Open questions

Exact principal-management controls remain a surface design choice; no implementation may turn unavailable data into a successful empty result.
