# Annotations

## Why this exists

An annotation is evidence of attention, not a comment that happens to sit near a sentence.

## Example workflow

A researcher highlights a paragraph on a named Version, writes a private note, later searches the Annotation rail, and chooses whether to carry a repaired anchor to a new Version.

## Product contract

- Annotations share an anchored-contribution substrate with Comments and revision notes but retain their own purpose and lifecycle.
- Each records source representation, selector, named Version and exact revision context where available, author, scope, and provenance.
- Quiet in-content marks open to a searchable, filterable Annotation rail; annotations can project to Collections and Canvas without becoming copies.
- Ordinary edits attempt relocation. Unresolved anchors are explicit orphan/repair states; parallel Versions never silently merge annotation meaning.

## Boundaries and non-goals

Reader owns reading interaction; citations own formal source references; comments own feedback threads. An Annotation is not automatically public, shared, or portable to an incompatible source.

## Acceptance stories

### Preserve an exact revision anchor

Given a highlight on a named Page Version, when that Page later changes, then the Annotation retains its original revision context and either relocates with evidence or appears as needing repair.

### Respect private scope

Given a private Annotation on a shared Page, when another collaborator opens the Page or an aggregate, then the Annotation and any derived count are not exposed.

## Current evidence

Donor evidence: anchored Comments and revision history provide related primitives. No durable Annotation object, rail, revision-aware selector, or carry-forward proof exists; this record remains `approved_shape`.

## Proof plan

1. Define anchored contribution and multimodal selector models.
2. Test scope, edits, orphaning, re-anchor, parallel Versions, exports, and access-safe projections.
3. Verify Reader highlight-to-rail-to-repair workflow.

## Open questions

- Automatic relocation confidence thresholds and batch carry-forward UI remain open.
