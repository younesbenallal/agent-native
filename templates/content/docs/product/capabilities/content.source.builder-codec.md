# Builder round-trip codec

## Why this exists

Connected editing is only trustworthy if unfamiliar provider material survives the journey home.

## Example workflow

An editor changes a mapped Builder article body. The codec writes supported blocks, preserves an unknown component as raw source-owned data, detects a changed provider baseline, and leaves publishing as a separate review action.

## Product contract

- One pure typed codec is shared by repo-backed docs and CMS-backed collections where the representation applies.
- Known blocks map to typed Content structures; unknown components retain raw payload, provider identity, ordering, and fidelity state.
- Baselines and hashes detect stale/conflicting writes. Codec output is deterministic and covered by golden fixtures.
- Codec conversion does not decide source truth, write mode, review, or provider publication; adapter and sync policy own those decisions.

## Boundaries and non-goals

This is Builder-specific format machinery, not generic Source behavior or a guarantee that every Builder component becomes editable.

## Acceptance stories

### Preserve an unknown component

Given a Builder article contains one unknown component and one supported text block, when the editor changes the text and writes back, then the unknown component remains unchanged with provider provenance.

### Stop on a stale baseline

Given Builder changes the source after Content reads it, when Content attempts write-back, then the codec reports a baseline conflict and does not overwrite the newer provider representation.

## Current evidence

Donor evidence: `actions/_builder-cms-source-adapter.ts`, `actions/_builder-cms-source-adapter.test.ts`, and `shared/builder-source-component-registry.ts` provide concrete Builder conversion substrate. No single certified pure codec and complete golden/conflict workflow proof exists; this record remains `approved_shape`.

## Proof plan

1. Extract or define pure codec inputs, outputs, opaque fallbacks, and fidelity reports.
2. Add golden, malformed, hash, conflict, and unknown-preservation fixtures.
3. Verify a supported edit, unknown preservation, review, and guarded publish workflow.

## Open questions

- The first supported component matrix and raw-payload archive encoding remain open.
