# Comments

## Why this exists

Feedback should remain attached to the sentence, image, or Block it concerns, even when the work is embedded in another place. Otherwise discussion becomes a trail of vague ghosts.

## Example workflow

A reviewer comments on two Blocks in a brief, replies with a Page reference, and resolves the thread after revision. Later the brief is embedded elsewhere; the comment still opens under the original Page context and its historical target.

## Product contract

- A Comment thread is owned by one Page and may target one or several Blocks or ranges in its Blocks fields.
- Rich Comment bodies use the shared Blocks-field grammar; replies and mentions retain the same Page authority.
- Anchors follow stable Block identity where possible and preserve historical target context after deletion rather than attaching to plausible new text.
- Resolve, reopen, edit, reply, and notification operations use shared Actions and record attributable change.
- Comments submitted through MCP or the in-app agent's Action tools retain the authenticated account as their author and separately persist their submission source. The UI and notifications identify them as posted via AI on that person's behalf; this describes submission, not a claim that AI wrote every word. Replies record their own source, edits preserve the original submission attribution, and historical comments without provenance remain unclassified.
- A structured `@AI` or connected-model mention in the Comment composer explicitly invokes AI. The inline model tile shows the selected provider and model and is where the model is changed; a Comment addresses at most one model, while people can be mentioned freely. Send offers Auto, Reply in thread, Suggest changes, or Apply changes and resolve. Auto resolves one of those three bounded intents before execution; Suggest changes uses the existing suggested-edits availability and access rules.
- Every AI request binds the authenticated requester, Page body, original root Comment and thread, submitted conversation, revision, exact agent thread and initial turn. A scoped run can use only that intent's dedicated operation; targeting and write authority do not come from chat history or model-written arguments.
- Each explicit AI Send keeps its source Comment, submitted mode, resolved intent, operation, agent thread, provider/model identity, and reasoning attempts distinct. Unrelated Page edits trigger a bounded contextual refresh or exact-target reanchor; changed feedback, ambiguous targets, and partial saves remain typed, recoverable states on the original thread.
- Comment AI runs stay out of the active chat until a person explicitly opens them. Progress and the resulting response appear on the source Comment; an AI-addressed follow-up continues that exact agent thread, while a newly requested mutation starts a separately scoped operation. Open AI conversation reveals the exact authorized session with a Comment-specific prefill.
- Reply adds an AI-attributed answer to the original thread without editing or resolving. Suggest creates a native proposal linked in both directions and leaves the original thread open, including after human acceptance. Apply-and-resolve verifies the saved edit and unchanged source conversation before resolving; conflicts and partial success remain available for review. The resolved thread shows a bounded before/after of what changed and stays in view until the person dismisses it. Its requester can undo the change, which reverses the exact saved edits and reopens the thread, only while the changed text is still as AI left it.
- Retrying one request recovers its retained operation and result. It does not silently replace its intent, duplicate a reply or proposal, or reapply a saved edit. Unknown historical authorship is not retrospectively labeled AI.
- References and embeds display the authoritative Page-owned thread; they do not clone or re-home it.
- A person or agent with comment access can react to a Comment or reply with one emoji at a time through the shared reaction Action. Each person reacts with a given emoji at most once, reactions inherit the Comment's access, and deleting the Comment removes them. Suggested-edit discussions present reactions the same way while keeping their own storage.

## Boundaries and non-goals

- Comments are exact-material feedback, not the Page-wide Discussion timeline.
- A comment does not create a Page, Collection membership, or independent share policy.
- This capability does not define named Version access, although Comments retain Version context.

## Acceptance stories

### React without replying

Given an open Comment, when a commenter adds 👍 twice and 🎉 once, the thread shows one 👍 and one 🎉 marked as theirs; removing 👍 leaves only 🎉, a person without comment access cannot react, and deleting the Comment removes its reactions.

### Preserve a deleted anchor

Given a Comment on a Block range, when the range and Block are deleted, then the Comment remains resolvable and opens authorized historical context instead of moving to a new nearby range.

### Keep one authoritative thread across an embed

Given a Page with a Comment thread is referenced or embedded elsewhere, when a viewer opens the thread from either occurrence, then they see the same Page-owned thread and access decision.

### Keep concurrent AI work attached to its source

Given AI is mentioned in two Comments while the Page is also edited, when both operations reason and commit, then each uses a distinct operation and agent thread, preserves its submitted mode and resolved intent, tolerates unrelated changes, and leaves any true source or target conflict open with a typed recovery state.

### Choose how AI handles feedback

Given an open Page-body Comment and an unfinished human reply, inserting or removing the AI mention tile preserves the draft and dispatches nothing. AI Send with Reply adds one AI answer to that same thread. Suggest creates a reviewable proposal without changing accepted text. Only Apply changes and resolve may change accepted text and resolve, and only after both the saved revision and original feedback have been checked. Auto must first persist a finite resolved intent and then obey the same boundaries.

### Review an applied AI change

Given AI applied and resolved a Comment while the Page is open, the thread stays beside the changed text with what it replaced, Undo, and Done until the person moves on or dismisses it. Undo restores the original text and reopens the thread; if the changed text was edited since, Undo changes nothing and says why.

### Recover partial AI work

Given an edit was saved but its receipt or resolution failed, reopening the Page exposes that partial result. Retrying the same request reuses the saved edit receipt and attempts only unfinished work. If the Page or feedback changed in the meantime, the thread stays open for review.

## Current evidence

`document_comments` schema and editor Comment UI/actions provide anchored threaded-comment substrate. Stable multi-Block anchors, rich universal fields, historical repair, and embed authority are not fully proven; this remains `approved_shape`.

The anchored editor workflow includes document-session drafts, author text editing,
readable resolved conversations, and optimistic comment mutations with scoped
refreshes. Behavioral coverage lives in `CommentsSidebar.interaction.test.tsx`,
`comment-drafts.test.tsx`, `DocumentEditor.layout.test.ts`,
`use-comments.mutations.test.ts`, and `update-comment.test.ts`. These cover draft
retention, responsive sizing, failed and overlapping mutations, and existing
commenter/editor access. They do not establish the broader multi-Block,
historical-deletion, notification, or embed contracts above.

The action/runtime substrate now persists isolated Comment AI operations and
attempt-specific Page and discussion bases. Database-backed concurrency coverage
proves distinct operations across Comments, one active operation per source
Comment across simultaneous starts, bounded reply refresh, disjoint apply commits,
typed overlapping-target and discussion conflicts, idempotent receipts, lifecycle
status reconciliation, and agent model attribution. The editor now starts these
sessions without changing the active chat, keeps per-Comment progress and recovery
state, renders attributed replies on the source thread, and allows an explicit
same-thread continuation or handoff. Live local acceptance proved distinct hidden
threads, concurrent loading, unchanged navigation, fresh retry identity, and
recoverable failure UI; a successful model/tool completion and inline continuation
remain required integration proof.

## Proof plan

1. Create, reply, mention, resolve, reopen, edit, and delete Comments through UI and Actions.
2. Test anchors through Block editing, move, split, deletion, restore, and named-Version context.
3. Verify references, embeds, access changes, notifications, agents, and exports.
4. Exercise concurrent replies/resolution, reload, keyboard, and assistive technology.

## Open questions

Anchor matching heuristics may evolve, but they may never silently claim a new target is the old one.
