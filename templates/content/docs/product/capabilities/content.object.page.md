# Pages

## Why this exists

A person needs a durable home for a piece of work, not a row that changes identity with its location or a file that cannot carry access and collaboration context.

## Example workflow

An editor creates a brief, adds body content and Properties, places it in two Collections, shares it with a colleague, then moves it in the sidebar. The same Page URL, comments, history, and source/export identity continue to refer to the brief.

## Product contract

- A Page owns stable identity, title, access, top-level Properties, and one or more Blocks fields.
- A Collection row is a Page; membership supplies collection context but never replaces Page identity or creates a primary membership.
- UI, agents, automations, and APIs use shared Actions and the same authorization boundary.
- References, comments, Discussion, history, Versions, sources, and exports target the Page identity, not a transient renderer or location.
- Trash suspends ordinary use without silently reusing the identity; restore returns the Page with its durable context.

## Boundaries and non-goals

- A Page is not a Blocks field, Collection membership, Query result, or named Version.
- Page identity does not grant access to a source, another membership, or a referenced object.
- The Page foundation does not itself define stable Block anchors, source synchronization, or Version branching.

## Acceptance stories

### Move without becoming another document

Given a Page in two Collections, when an editor moves it in navigation or removes one membership, then its URL, body, comments, and remaining membership still resolve to the same Page.

### Deny before revealing context

Given a person who knows a Page link but lacks access, when they open it through UI or an Action, then they receive an honest denial and no title, body, membership, or comment data leaks.

## Current evidence

`server/db/schema.ts` defines durable document rows with IDs, content, ownership, source context, and trash attribution. `update-document` persists Page changes through Actions and snapshots prior content. The dedicated Trash surface and `list-content-trash` search authorized deletion roots and nested descendants without changing Page identity; `get-trashed-document` provides a read-only body preview. Planned permanent deletion freezes Page IDs and deletion generations before execution, persists per-item outcomes, and leaves later or changed Trash outside the confirmed scope. This is current Page-lifecycle evidence, not proof of richer property, comment, History, or generic durable-job contracts.

## Proof plan

1. Create, rename, move, multi-home, trash, restore, and export Pages through UI and Actions.
2. Verify identical access decisions for direct links, search, memberships, comments, and agent reads.
3. Reload during edits and recovery, confirming stable identity and no duplicate Page.
4. Check keyboard and assistive-technology navigation and portable Markdown/MDX output.

## Open questions

No open product question changes the verified Page foundation. Richer Page property and source behavior belongs to its adjacent records.
