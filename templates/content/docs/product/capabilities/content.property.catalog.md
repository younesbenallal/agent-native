# Custom Properties

## Why this exists

Same-named columns are not shared meaning. Organizations need a way to reuse a field deliberately, understand where it came from, and evolve it without silently rewriting a local collection.

## Example workflow

Marta publishes Customer tier, a collection adopts it, previews an enum update, and another collection detaches locally while keeping values.

## Product contract

- The add-column picker distinguishes built-in local types, source-backed fields, and personal, workspace, or organization Custom Properties.
- A definition's stable identity—not its name—controls query meaning, provenance, and compatible updates.
- A consumer may detach to a local field; updates are reviewed and impact-previewed, never silently applied.

## Boundaries and non-goals

- `content.property.typed` owns type semantics and Template governance owns catalog policy; Custom Properties own reusable definition/adoption identity.
- The catalog does not equate columns by name, make local columns secretly global, or auto-migrate incompatible values.

## Acceptance stories

### Labels are not identity

Given local and organization Status fields, when an author opens Add column, then Add column distinguishes their IDs and origins.

### Stage risky migration

Given a breaking type/option update, when its owner proposes publication, then Content previews impact and blocks or stages unsafe conversion.

## Current evidence

`server/plugins/db.ts`, `actions/configure-document-property.ts`, `actions/bind-content-database-source-field.ts`, and `DocumentProperties.tsx` are donors; catalog/adoption/detach/migration do not exist.

## Proof plan

1. Build scoped Add column discovery with IDs/provenance.
2. Adopt across collections and test semantics/access.
3. Publish compatible/breaking versions with impact/migration/receipts.
4. Detach without losing values.

## Open questions

Scope names need root judgment.
