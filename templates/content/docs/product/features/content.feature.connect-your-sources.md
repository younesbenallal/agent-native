example_workflow: "A content lead connects Builder blog articles and resources, aligns their compatible fields in one Query, and works from a shared editorial View without losing which provider owns each record."

remains: "Sources need one governed catalog, Queries need to replace the confusing multi-source configuration surface, and field alignment, write routing, and access behavior need end-to-end proof."

# Feature 9: Connect your sources

Choose governed native and provider Sources, preserve their identity, and compose them through Queries and Views.

## Product contract

- **Sources catalog:** Lists approved personal, workspace, and organization connections with their capabilities and policy.
- **Provider adapters:** Give Builder, Notion, Drive, Agent-Native apps, and later providers one shared contract with independent certification.
- **Item binding:** Maps each provider item to one stable Content identity without turning the provider into the Page's owner.
- **Typed Queries:** Combine Collections, Sources, and other Queries through one visual selection and alignment model.
- **Provenance:** Shows where each value or representation came from and which system owns changes to it.
- **Access-safe results:** Evaluate every result and aggregate with the current viewer's authority rather than the Query owner's.
