# Feature 18: Run projects your way

Use an editable Task and Project system built from ordinary Content rather than a second hidden engine.

## Product contract

- **Blessed Template:** Provides a strong starting system that remains inspectable and editable like any other Content setup.
- **Fast capture:** Creates work quickly with unambiguous View-derived defaults and useful keyboard navigation.
- **Assignments:** Use ordinary typed Person and Team Properties with access-safe attention and notifications.
- **Subtasks and dependencies:** Store hierarchy and blocking relationships through typed Relations with cycle protection.
- **My Tasks:** Queries assigned work across authorized memberships without inventing a private task datastore.
- **Project status:** Combines explicit owner judgment with useful rollups rather than pretending a formula can manage the project.
- **Ordinary Pages:** Lets every Task retain rich content, Properties, Discussion, Versions, and the ability to join other Collections.
