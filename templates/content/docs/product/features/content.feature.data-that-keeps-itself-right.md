summary: "Use typed defaults, formulas, validation, and rendering so ordinary data stays consistent."
example_workflow: "An operations lead creates a request Collection whose defaults fill the creator and timestamp, formulas calculate cost, validation rejects an impossible quantity, and a guarded budget change explains its consequences before committing."
works_today: "Content has a broad typed Property system, formulas and computed fields, editable values, form-required fields, audit fields, and several useful validation donors."
remains: "Defaults, formulas, validation, conditional rendering, guarded changes, typed errors, and time semantics need one expression language and one coherent configuration surface across every Property type."

# Feature 13: Data that keeps itself right

Use typed defaults, formulas, validation, and rendering so ordinary data stays consistent.

## Product contract

- **Typed Properties:** Give text, numbers, choices, dates, people, relationships, files, and rich Blocks explicit behavior.
- **Creation defaults:** Evaluate one-time typed Expressions inside the successful creation transaction.
- **Formulas:** Derive live values from the current row and related data without storing a second truth.
- **Validation:** Reject invalid values consistently across the interface, Actions, API, agents, imports, and Forms.
- **Safeguards:** Add customizable consequence text, confirmation, approval, or conditional authority before sensitive changes commit.
- **Typed errors:** Keep null, error, unavailable, and stale cached values distinct and understandable.
- **Time semantics:** Separate Dates from timezone-aware Instants and quarantine ambiguous legacy floating times honestly.
