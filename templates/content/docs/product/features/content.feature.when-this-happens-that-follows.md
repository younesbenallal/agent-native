example_workflow: "When a qualified lead enters a Collection, a Rule assigns the owner, asks an agent for a bounded summary, sends the right notification, and leaves one receipt showing every action and retry."
works_today: "Shared Actions, audit history, a framework scheduler, notifications, Automations, provider effects, and active Event and Rule work already cover much of the execution substrate."

# Feature 17: When this happens, that follows

React to committed Events with visible, governed Actions, retries, notifications, and receipts.

## Product contract

- **Events:** Provide atomic facts about what committed, who or what caused it, and which objects changed.
- **Rules:** Match typed conditions after commit without becoming a second expression or permission engine.
- **Actions:** Invoke the same operations available to the interface and agents.
- **Schedules and heartbeats:** Use the framework's single scheduler for time-based conditions and missed-run policy.
- **Buttons:** Give owners an explicit interface for invoking governed Actions with known inputs and consequences.
- **Agent effects:** Delegate bounded work without granting the Rule more authority than its actor or policy permits.
- **Receipts and retries:** Preserve exactly-once claims, crash recovery, honest skips, and queryable outcomes.
