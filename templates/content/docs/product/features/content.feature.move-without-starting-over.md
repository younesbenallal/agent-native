# Feature 30: Move without starting over

Import or migrate a foreign corpus with resumable progress, provenance, repair, and a readable conversion report.

## Product contract

- **Canonical import model:** Maps Pages, Collections, Properties, Blocks, relationships, files, and metadata into stable Content objects.
- **Provider-specific adapters:** Interpret Notion, local vaults, Builder, Drive, and later formats without making any provider's dialect the core model.
- **Checkpoint and resume:** Continues large migrations after interruption without duplicating already accepted records.
- **Identity and deduplication:** Preserves stable source IDs and makes repeated imports repair or update the intended objects.
- **Conversion report:** Explains unsupported or transformed semantics instead of quietly dropping them.
- **Repair workflows:** Lets people and agents inspect unresolved mappings, missing assets, conflicts, and partial failures.
- **Provenance:** Keeps enough source context to compare, refresh, or understand the imported material later.
