# Feature 15: Put your organization's know-how to work

Govern reusable Skills so the agent offers the right instructions for the current person and object.

## Product contract

- **Skills catalog:** Stores governed instructions with personal, workspace, organization, or public-core scope.
- **Compatibility:** Surfaces only Skills that apply to the current selection, Block, Page, Collection, Property, or View.
- **Scope precedence:** Ranks the most relevant allowed instruction without flooding the interface with the entire catalog.
- **Declared effects:** Explains whether invocation proposes edits, replaces content, adds a Comment, or acts elsewhere.
- **Shared invocation:** Lets people and agents use the same Skill through the ordinary Agent chat and Action fabric.
- **Receipts:** Records what instruction ran, against which context, with which resulting actions.
