# Feature 22: Understand what your data says

Use Charts, Pivots, grouping, measures, and drill-down without creating a separate analytics datastore.

## Product contract

- **Multiple grouping dimensions:** Partitions typed Query results consistently across Views.
- **Measures and totals:** Compute access-safe counts, sums, averages, subtotals, and grand totals.
- **Charts:** Share one typed chart specification and renderer toolkit with Agent-Native Analytics.
- **Pivot:** Places dimensions on rows and columns with typed aggregations in cells.
- **Drill-down:** Opens the canonical records behind an aggregate instead of turning cells into independent data.
- **Accessible summaries:** Explains the chart or pivot meaning beyond color, shape, or pointer interaction.
- **Static fidelity:** Preserves useful output in public Pages, presentations, and exports.
