# Feature 5: See your information your way

Move among compatible Collection and Query Views without changing the records underneath.

## Product contract

- **Table and List:** Support fast scanning, keyboard navigation, inline editing, and flexible visible fields.
- **Board and Gallery:** Arrange records by workflow state or visual identity while preserving canonical records.
- **Calendar and Timeline:** Place records across dates and ranges through the same typed time Properties.
- **Form:** Collect new records through a saved presentation of the Collection's schema and validation.
- **View controls:** Filter, sort, group, format, and conditionally style each presentation.
- **Density:** Adjust compact, cozy, or comfortable spacing and secondary information without creating another View type.
- **Renderer conformance:** Gives every View the same permissions, Actions, agent context, accessibility, persistence, and recovery contract.
