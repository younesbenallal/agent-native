summary: "Mount and edit the same canonical Content object inside an authorized host without forking identity or permissions."
example_workflow: "A planner mounts the canonical project brief inside another Agent-Native app, edits it through the same Actions, and sees the change, history, and permissions remain identical when opening it later in Content."
works_today: "Agent-Native toolkits already share Content components across sibling apps, and Content exposes reusable Actions and object identities that hosts can call without duplicating business logic."
remains: "A canonical embeddable surface needs host grants, viewer-scoped authorization, shared editing and history, stable mounting contracts, responsive presentation, and later MCP App compatibility."

# Feature 31: Work on Content inside another application

Mount and edit the same canonical Content object inside an authorized host without forking identity or permissions.

## Product contract

- **Canonical mount:** Renders the actual Page, View, or focused Content surface rather than a copied snapshot.
- **Host grant:** Gives one named application only the mount and Action capabilities it needs.
- **Viewer authority:** Never lets the host widen what the signed-in person could see or edit in Content itself.
- **Shared Actions:** Routes edits through the same validation, permissions, Events, history, and agent surface.
- **Agent-Native toolkits:** Reuse common components and behavior across sibling applications without coupling them to the Content app shell.
- **MCP App widening:** Later exposes the same governed surface to compatible external agent hosts once identity and presentation contracts are proven.
