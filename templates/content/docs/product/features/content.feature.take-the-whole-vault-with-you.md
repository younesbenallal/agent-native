# Feature 29: Take the whole vault with you

Export the complete authorized vault into open, understandable formats and a lossless Content archive.

## Product contract

- **Open vault:** Uses Markdown or MDX, CSV, ordinary asset folders, and a small manifest for stable IDs and richer semantics.
- **Lossless Content archive:** Preserves Versions, Discussion, Comments, Annotations, Rules, provenance, and other Content-specific meaning.
- **Target packages:** Produces destination-aware exports, beginning with a Notion-compatible package and conversion report.
- **Authorized closure:** Materializes exactly what the exporter can currently see without leaking inaccessible dependencies.
- **Assets and Sources:** Includes authorized files or stable handles and reports anything that could not be resolved.
- **Durable transfer job:** Supports progress, interruption, retry, and resume without duplicating work.
- **Local backup:** Lets Desktop maintain a user-chosen portable vault separately from its fast disposable cache.
