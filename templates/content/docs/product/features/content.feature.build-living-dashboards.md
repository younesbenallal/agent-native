# Feature 23: Build living dashboards

Compose responsive Views, Charts, expressions, controls, and prose into durable operating surfaces.

## Product contract

- **Ordinary Pages:** Serve as the dashboard canvas without introducing a separate dashboard datastore.
- **Embedded Views and Charts:** Reference saved configurations while allowing each occurrence to override size and presentation.
- **Responsive columns:** Arrange, resize, and reorder Blocks with a layout that linearizes coherently on smaller screens and in exports.
- **Controls and Expressions:** Let viewers change authorized filters or inputs without mutating the shared default accidentally.
- **Live context:** Keeps prose, decisions, metrics, and the underlying records together for people and agents.
- **Presentation mode:** Reuses shared Slides primitives to present Pages or ordered records without inventing slide-only content.
