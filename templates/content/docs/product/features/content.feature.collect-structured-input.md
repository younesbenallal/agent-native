# Feature 21: Collect structured input

Build Forms over the same schema, validation, and submission Actions as the Collection they populate.

## Product contract

- **Form View:** Saves field selection, order, presentation, and submission behavior over one Collection.
- **Shared schema:** Reuses the same Property types and validation as Agent-Native Forms and ordinary record editing.
- **Conditional fields:** Shows or requires inputs through the typed expression language rather than custom form-only logic.
- **Submission grants:** Allow a person to submit without silently granting broad access to the underlying Collection.
- **Idempotent submission:** Prevents duplicate records when a request retries or returns ambiguously.
- **Receipts:** Records the submitted values, actor, resulting Page, and downstream Actions the submitter may inspect.
