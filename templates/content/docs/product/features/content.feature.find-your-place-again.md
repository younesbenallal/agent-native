# Feature 2: Find your place again

Content makes arrival, navigation, and resumption feel dependable instead of asking people to remember where they left everything.

## Product contract

- **Home:** Gives each person a top-level view across the Personal and organization contexts they can access.
- **Workspaces:** Organize Pages and Collections beneath Personal or an Organization without becoming the permission model themselves.
- **Sidebar:** Pins important Pages, Collections, and Queries while allowing dynamic sections such as Recent and Shared with me.
- **Recent work:** Restores the objects and views a person was actually using, scoped by current access.
- **Known links and invitations:** Land on the intended object with an honest access-denied state when permission is missing.
- **Session resumption:** Reopens enough navigation and View state to pick up the work without reconstructing the route manually.
