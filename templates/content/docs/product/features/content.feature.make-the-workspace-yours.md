# Feature 4: Make the workspace yours

Personal arrangements and private Views reshape shared work without changing it for everyone else.

## Product contract

- **Personal View changes:** Remember one person's filters, sorting, grouping, density, and presentation over a shared View.
- **Only-me Views:** Save named private Views over shared records without forking their data.
- **Shared Views:** Give collaborators a dependable starting presentation while preserving personal exploration.
- **Saved Queries:** Turn reusable selection and output logic into durable Content objects that can be linked and embedded.
- **Multiple Collection memberships:** Let one Page participate in several collections without gaining a primary Collection identity.
- **Pinned navigation:** Let each person choose the working set that deserves persistent space in the sidebar.
