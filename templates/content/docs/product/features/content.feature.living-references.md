# Feature 3: Living references

Reuse canonical Pages and Blocks without producing copies that quietly drift apart.

## Product contract

- **References:** Link to a Page or Block as a compact mention, card, or embedded preview.
- **Synced Blocks:** Render one canonical Block in several places and allow authorized edits from any occurrence.
- **Embedded Pages:** Place a canonical Page inside another surface while preserving its identity and access.
- **Backlinks and forward links:** Show where an object is mentioned and what it intentionally references through Info → Connections.
- **Typed Relationships:** Give important connections explicit meaning that Collections, Queries, Graphs, and agents can use.
- **Graceful degradation:** Omit inaccessible references and preserve understandable broken or deleted-reference states.
