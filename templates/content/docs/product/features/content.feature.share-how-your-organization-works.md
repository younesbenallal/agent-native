# Feature 14: Share how your organization works

Govern reusable Templates, Properties, Expressions, and Custom Blocks without taking ownership away from adopters.

## Product contract

- **Templates:** Package Pages, Collections, Views, Properties, Rules, and content into reusable starting systems.
- **Custom Properties:** Offer approved reusable field definitions without making every ordinary local column secretly global.
- **Expressions:** Store reusable typed logic with personal, workspace, or organization scope.
- **Catalog discovery:** Uses consistent names, descriptions, aliases, ownership, compatibility, and previews.
- **Adoption:** Lets someone inspect a governed building block before binding it into their local system.
- **Detachment:** Preserves the current data and behavior as a faithful local copy when someone leaves the shared lineage.
