# Feature 16: Evolve systems safely

Review upstream changes to adopted systems, keep local work intact, and choose what to accept or detach.

## Product contract

- **Version pinning:** Keeps each adopted Template or Custom Property on the version its owner trusts.
- **Impact preview:** Shows affected Collections, Views, Queries, formulas, Rules, Templates, and agent workflows before publication.
- **Three-way comparison:** Distinguishes the old shared definition, the proposed update, and local changes.
- **Selective adoption:** Lets each owner accept compatible changes, decline others, or apply a safe batch.
- **Quiet decline memory:** Avoids repeatedly demanding review until the upstream change materially differs.
- **Detach to local:** Ends the shared lineage without breaking the current system or losing provenance.
