# Feature 24: Capture into action

Resolve or create one canonical Page in the chosen Collection, preserve provenance, and hand it to that Collection's Rules and agents.

## Product contract

- **Many entrances:** Accepts browser capture, share sheets, Clips, URLs, files, email, identifiers, providers, and Agent Actions through one contract.
- **Remembered destination:** Defaults to the last Collection used for that entrance while keeping the destination easy to change.
- **Idempotent resolution:** Finds an existing canonical Page or creates exactly one, with a deliberate-copy escape hatch.
- **Provenance:** Preserves the original URL, identifier, provider identity, capture time, snapshot, and available representations.
- **Collection handoff:** Applies the destination's Template, defaults, memberships, validation, and permissions.
- **Downstream enrichment:** Lets target-owned Rules and agents summarize, classify, extract, or route the record without making Capture wait for them.
- **Receipts and repair:** Reports what Capture created or reused and allows failed later enrichment to retry independently.
