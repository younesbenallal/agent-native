const BLOCK_HEADING_NOTE = `

## Block headings

Blocks do not take a \`title\`. To give a block a heading, place a \`rich-text\` block whose markdown is a \`###\` (h3) heading directly above the block. Those headings are real, inline-editable, and appear in the document outline — unlike the legacy block \`title\` field, which renders as a small muted label and cannot be edited in place. This includes the bottom Open Questions form: put an \`### Open Questions\` heading above the \`question-form\` block rather than titling it. The \`title\` field still renders for older plans, but do not set it on new blocks.`;

const AUTHORING_RULES_NOTE = `

## Authoring rules

**Diagrams**: use \`diagram\` blocks with \`data.html\`/\`data.css\`. Use renderer-owned classes: \`.diagram-panel\`, \`.diagram-card\`, \`.diagram-node\`, \`.diagram-box\`, \`.diagram-pill\`, \`.diagram-muted\`, plus \`data-rough\`. Use \`--wf-*\` CSS tokens for color; never set custom fonts or hard-code hex/rgb/hsl values. Legacy nodes/edges only for tiny previews or true step-by-step flows. Use \`mermaid\` only when textual grammar is materially clearer than a spatial layout.

**Wireframes**: set \`data.html\` to a semantic HTML fragment; pick a surface (desktop/mobile/popover/panel/browser). The renderer owns theme, footprint/aspect, Excalifont, and rough.js sketch overlay. Use \`--wf-*\` CSS tokens for any custom color (never hex). Prototype screens use semantic HTML with \`data-goto\` attributes for navigation.

**Page alignment**: for browser or desktop page-like screens, give the outer root explicit padding and keep the body in a centered wrapper such as \`width:100%;max-width:720px;margin-inline:auto\`. Full-width app bars may span the root, but onboarding, auth, settings, and other page content should not hug the artboard edge unless the real product does.

**Visual frames**: \`wireframe\` and \`diagram\` data accept \`frame: "auto" | "show" | "hide"\`. Leave it unset/\`auto\` when the host context should decide: Plan and recap surfaces default to framed; docs default to unframed. Use \`frame: "show"\` for standalone product screens, before/after recap comparisons, screenshot-like artifacts, and visuals that need containment from surrounding prose. Use \`frame: "hide"\` when a docs page, tab, column, card, canvas artboard, or the visual's own internal chrome already supplies the boundary. Hiding the outer frame must not remove inner padding, meaningful card/field/button borders, or the visual's readable structure.

**Canvas storyboards**: if the user asks for a canvas, storyboard, wireframe, light storyboard, UI flow, screen flow, product flow, mockup, or visual comparison, the primary artifact must be \`content.canvas\` / \`canvas.mdx\` with \`DesignBoard\` artboards containing \`Screen\` HTML wireframes. Each canvas \`Screen\` must carry \`html\` / \`data.html\`; never author fresh nested kit-tree children such as \`<FrameScreen>\`, \`<Card>\`, \`<Row>\`, or \`<Btn>\` inside canvas \`<Screen>\` tags. Kit trees are old-plan compatibility only and often render worse on the pan/zoom canvas than HTML wireframes. Do not use document-body \`diagram\` blocks for the primary UI story. Use \`diagram\` only for architecture, data flow, or implementation mechanics below the canvas, and only after the UI storyboard exists.

**Before/After columns**: compose a \`columns\` block from \`<Column>\` CHILDREN — never a \`columns=\` attribute or inline JSON array. Author it as \`<Columns><Column label="Before">…child block(s)…</Column><Column label="After">…child block(s)…</Column></Columns>\`. Each \`<Column>\` wraps real nested blocks (e.g. a \`Wireframe\`); the parser fills in column ids and child-block \`data\` from that markup, whereas a \`columns=\` attribute array leaves them missing and FAILS schema validation. For UI state comparisons put one \`wireframe\` block in each side and label the columns \`Before\` and \`After\`; the renderer draws labels as headings and lays narrow surfaces side by side. Never bake Before/After labels inside the wireframe HTML or hand-stack the pair.

**MDX prose and component syntax**: write ordinary top-level prose as normal Markdown; it imports as rich-text automatically. Use \`<RichText id="...">…</RichText>\` only when prose needs explicit metadata such as \`title\`, \`summary\`, or \`editable\`, or when preserving a referenced block id. Every capitalized block component must be self-closing (\`<Diagram id="..." data={{ ... }} />\`) or have a matching closing tag around children (\`<RichText id="...">…</RichText>\`). Never write a bare opening tag like \`<RichText ...>\` as a paragraph; the MDX parser treats it as unclosed JSX and import fails before the plan can render.

**Code-bearing blocks**: \`code\`, \`annotated-code\`, and \`diff\` are whitespace-sensitive. Prefer the exact MDX form emitted by the authoring examples / source exporter, where multiline code is encoded as JSON string attributes such as \`code={\"const x =\\\\n  y\"}\`. Static template literals are accepted and preserve indentation, but they must be static strings with no \`\${...}\` interpolation.

**File maps**: prefer \`annotated-code\` blocks (real code + line-anchored notes) grouped in a vertical \`tabs\` block, one tab per key file. Drop to a plain \`code\` block only for throwaway snippets with nothing to call out.

**Tabs grouping**: use horizontal \`TabsBlock\` groups for multiple related diffs so each split diff gets full document width.

**API endpoints**: keep \`api-endpoint\` and \`openapi-spec\` blocks in normal single-column document flow. Use \`columns\` only for an explicit before/after contract comparison.

**Visual fidelity and renderMode**: leave \`renderMode\` unset or set it to \`wireframe\` for normal wireframes. “Clean,” “minimal,” “high UX bar,” or Linear/Vercel references set the content and density bar, not full-fidelity mode. Only explicit “higher fidelity,” “pixel-accurate,” “polished mockup,” “production-like,” “real design,” or “not a sketch/wireframe” requires \`renderMode: "design"\`, substantial branded HTML/CSS grounded in the real app, and stable \`data-design-id\` targets. Put scoped styles in the wireframe/prototype \`css\` field — never in a \`<style>\` tag. On an existing plan, update the same plan id with \`set-visual-render-mode\` plus the upgraded HTML/CSS; do not create a duplicate. The viewer-local Clean toggle is not a fidelity upgrade.

**Canvas fit**: canvas artboards are pan/zoom surfaces and do not scroll. Keep wireframe HTML in natural flow without an inner scroll region. If a screen is taller than the surface preset, set the artboard's explicit \`height\` larger than the default while keeping its surface width unchanged, then inspect the bottom edge at default zoom so no row, control, or footer is clipped.

**Payload integrity**: \`content\` is a complete replacement. Pass either \`content\` or the mode-specific convenience arrays (\`screens\`/\`transitions\` or \`states\`/\`components\`), never both; mixed inputs are rejected so CSS and blocks cannot disappear silently. For design content, keep the same HTML/CSS in the prototype screens and canvas frames. Rich-text \`data.markdown\` must contain real runtime line breaks; a one-line value containing literal \`\\n\` escape text will render as one giant heading and is rejected. After writing, re-read the structured plan and inspect the actual Plan surface before handoff.\``;
