/**
 * Guest-plan claim middleware — the server half of "sign in to keep your work".
 *
 * Hosted unauthenticated visitors author plans under a stable guest identity
 * (`guest-<uuid>@agent-native.guest`, pinned by the httpOnly `plan_guest_author`
 * cookie — see lib/public-plans.ts). When such a visitor signs in, this
 * middleware transfers the plans they made as a guest onto their real account on
 * their first authenticated request that still carries the guest cookie, then
 * clears the cookie.
 *
 * Why middleware and not an action: the cookie is httpOnly (the client can't read
 * it) and an action's run() has no access to the request event, so the claim must
 * run where both the session and the cookie are available. It is secure by
 * construction — a caller can only ever claim the guest identity proven by their
 * own cookie.
 *
 * Cheap on the hot path: the guest cookie is absent for the vast majority of
 * requests (real users, and guests once claimed), so we bail before touching the
 * session or DB. The UPDATE is idempotent and scoped to the caller's own guest
 * identity, so concurrent requests and repeats are safe.
