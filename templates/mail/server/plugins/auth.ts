// page only offers "Sign in with Google" — no email/password account
// creation, since that path can't be used to access mail.
//
// Gmail/Calendar/Contacts scopes are requested up front during the
// primary "Sign in with Google" flow. Tokens land in the framework's
// `oauth_tokens` table automatically (via a Better Auth account hook)
// so the existing `templates/mail/server/lib/google-auth.ts` client
// works on first sign-in — no separate "Connect Google" page needed.
// The template-specific routes under `/_agent-native/google/*` remain
// available for "add another account" flows.
