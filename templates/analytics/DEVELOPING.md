## Framework Basics (Nitro + @agent-native/core)

This app uses **Nitro** (via `@agent-native/core`) for the server. All server code lives in `server/`.

### Server Directory

```
server/
  routes/     # File-based route-only endpoints (auto-discovered by Nitro)
  handlers/   # Route handler logic modules
  plugins/    # Server plugins — run at startup (SSE, auth)
  lib/        # Shared server modules (helpers)
```

### Adding App Data

Normal app data starts as an action, not a custom route. Add `actions/<verb>-<resource>.ts` with `defineAction`, mark reads with `http: { method: "GET" }`, and call reads/writes from React with `useActionQuery` / `useActionMutation` from `@agent-native/core/client`. This keeps the UI and agent on one contract and lets mutating actions refresh action-backed queries automatically.

### Adding a Route-Only Endpoint

Use `server/routes/api/` only for protocols that cannot be modeled as JSON actions: multipart uploads, streaming/SSE/WebSocket, webhooks, OAuth callbacks/redirects, public SEO/OG endpoints, or binary/static asset serving. Do not add `/api/*` routes for normal CRUD, data queries, or pass-through wrappers around actions; the action endpoint already exists at `/_agent-native/actions/:name`.

Each route-only endpoint still exports a default `defineEventHandler`, but keep shared app logic in actions or server libraries so agent and UI behavior do not fork.

### Server Plugins

Startup logic (SSE, auth) lives in `server/plugins/`. Use `defineNitroPlugin` from core:

```ts
import { defineNitroPlugin } from "@agent-native/core";

export default defineNitroPlugin(async (nitroApp) => {
  // Runs once at server startup
});
```

### Key Imports from `@agent-native/core`

| Import                                       | Purpose                                           |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `defineNitroPlugin`                          | Define a server plugin (re-exported from Nitro)   |
| `createSSEHandler`                           | Create SSE endpoint for real-time updates         |
| `defineEventHandler`, `readBody`, `getQuery` | H3 route handler utilities (re-exported)          |
| `sendToAgentChat`                            | Send messages to agent from UI (client-side)      |
| `agentChat`                                  | Send messages to agent from scripts (server-side) |

| Import (settings)             | Purpose                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `getSetting` / `putSetting`   | Read/write app settings in SQL       |
| `getAppState` / `putAppState` | Read/write ephemeral UI state in SQL |

## Routing

Routes are file-based in `app/routes/` via `flatRoutes()`. Create a file to add a route (e.g. `app/routes/settings.tsx` → `/settings`).

- `app/routes/_index.tsx` — home/overview page (`/`)
- `app/routes/adhoc.$id.tsx` — dashboard router (`/adhoc/:id`)
- `app/pages/adhoc/` — dashboard page components, registered in `registry.ts`

### Tools vs Dashboards

The sidebar has two sections: **Dashboards** and **Tools**. Use the right one:

- **Dashboards** — data visualizations, charts, metrics, time-series. Things people look at to understand trends. Add to `dashboards` array in `registry.ts` and `dashboardComponents` map.
- **Tools** — functional utilities with inputs/actions (e.g. look up a customer, search Stripe, run a query). Things people _use_ to get specific answers. Add to the `defaultTools` array in `app/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`.

When a user asks for a **new feature, lookup tool, or interactive utility** → add it to **Tools**.
When a user asks for a **chart, metrics view, or data breakdown** → add it to **Dashboards**.

### Adding a Dashboard

**IMPORTANT**: When creating a new dashboard, YOU (the creator) must provide your name or email as the author. Do NOT pull this from git logs or other sources.

1. Create component in `app/pages/adhoc/my-dashboard/index.tsx` (these are regular components, not route files)
2. Use `<DashboardHeader />` component at the top to display metadata
3. Add entry to `dashboards` array in `app/pages/adhoc/registry.ts` with **REQUIRED fields**:
   - `id`: kebab-case identifier
   - `name`: Display name
   - `author`: **YOUR name or email** - the person creating this dashboard
   - `lastUpdated`: Today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format
4. Add lazy import to `dashboardComponents` in the same file

### Adding a Tool

**IMPORTANT**: When creating a new tool, YOU (the creator) must provide your name or email as the author.

1. Create component in `app/pages/adhoc/my-tool/index.tsx` (these are regular components, not route files)
2. Use `<DashboardHeader />` component at the top to display metadata
3. Add entry to `dashboards` array in `app/pages/adhoc/registry.ts` (for routing) with **REQUIRED fields**:
   - `author`: **YOUR name or email** - the person creating this tool
   - `lastUpdated`: Today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format
4. Add lazy import to `dashboardComponents` in the same file (for routing)
5. Add entry to `defaultTools` array in `app/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` (for sidebar placement)

## Styling

- **TailwindCSS 3** utility classes for all styling
- **Theme tokens** in `app/global.css`
- **`cn()`** utility combines `clsx` + `tailwind-merge` for conditional classes

## Build & Dev Commands

```bash
pnpm dev        # Start dev server with local PGlite (frontend + backend, port 8080)
pnpm build      # Production build
pnpm typecheck  # TypeScript validation
pnpm test       # Run Vitest tests
```

`pnpm dev` pins `DATABASE_URL` to `pglite:./data/pglite` so local work does not
accidentally touch a production database from `.env`. To intentionally test
against another PostgreSQL database, set `ANALYTICS_DATABASE_URL` for that command:

```bash
ANALYTICS_DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost/analytics_dev pnpm dev
```

## Creating Scripts

```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env tsx
import { parseArgs, output, fatal } from "./helpers";

const args = parseArgs();
if (!args.myArg) fatal("--myArg is required");

const result = await doSomething(args.myArg);
output(result);
```

Conventions:

- Import `parseArgs`, `output`, `fatal` from `./helpers`
- Import server libs directly (e.g., `../server/lib/bigquery`)
- Output JSON via `output()` for automatic `--grep`/`--fields` support
- Use `fatal()` for required arg validation
- `helpers.ts` loads `dotenv/config` so env vars are available

### Dedicated first-party Analytics backfill

`backfill:first-party-bigquery` is a resumable, bounded Neon-to-BigQuery worker
for an explicitly selected organization. It is dry-run by default. It uses the
scoped credential resolver, fixed high-water marks, separate organization and
legacy-owner cursors, atomic local checkpoints, a local lock, and a durable
database lease shared with the shipped worker. The tuple-paging indexes are
installed by the additive analytics migration, including a filtered cursor
index for the default `http.response` exclusion. By default it copies the most
recent 60 days, paging from the oldest eligible row to the newest so an
existing checkpoint can resume without duplicates or gaps. Use
`--lookback-days=30` when a 30-day window is sufficient; the worker accepts
30-60 days only. It skips the high-volume `http.response` infrastructure
telemetry by default. Override the exclusion list with `--skip-events=<csv>`;
an empty value includes every event name. It does not change the Analytics sink
or perform cutover.

```bash
pnpm backfill:first-party-bigquery \
  --owner-email=<owner-email> \
  --org-id=<org-id>
```

Production execution requires both `--execute` and the explicit
`AGENT_NATIVE_ANALYTICS_BIGQUERY_BACKFILL_ALLOW=1` environment gate. Start with a bounded
`--max-batches` budget and increase concurrency only after checking database
health between runs. The dedicated worker claims the durable migration-job
lease, so the shipped worker and another operator using a different checkpoint
path cannot copy the same job concurrently. A crashed dedicated worker leaves
that lease to expire before the shipped worker can resume it.

```bash
AGENT_NATIVE_ANALYTICS_BIGQUERY_BACKFILL_ALLOW=1 pnpm backfill:first-party-bigquery \
  --execute \
  --owner-email=<owner-email> \
  --org-id=<org-id> \
  --batch-size=1000 \
  --concurrency=2 \
  --max-batches=100
```

The shipped durable worker uses the same policy. Set
`ANALYTICS_BIGQUERY_BACKFILL_LOOKBACK_DAYS` and
`ANALYTICS_BIGQUERY_BACKFILL_SKIP_EVENTS` to override its 30-60 day window and
comma-separated event exclusions. The default exclusion is only
`http.response`; action responses, exceptions, pageviews, session events,
agent-run events, A2A invocations, session replay, and public-key metadata are
preserved.

### Postgres event volume guard

New tenants that remain on the default Postgres sink are capped at 1,000,000
accepted events per fixed UTC 30-day window. The reservation is atomic per
organization (or per owner for legacy personal keys), so concurrent `/track`
requests cannot overshoot the cap. Once reached, `/track` returns HTTP 429 with
guidance to connect an external analytics database or BigQuery. SQL-only
exception issues and public-key last-used metadata are still preserved for a
rejected batch; session replay uses its separate quota path.

Operators can raise or lower the guard with:

```bash
ANALYTICS_FIRST_PARTY_POSTGRES_EVENT_VOLUME_LIMIT=1000000
ANALYTICS_FIRST_PARTY_POSTGRES_EVENT_VOLUME_WINDOW_DAYS=30
```

The guard applies only while an organization uses the `postgres` sink. Dual
write and BigQuery-only organizations continue to accept events through the
warehouse path while the migration state machine controls cutover.

Postgres cleanup is intentionally a separate bounded action:
`purge-first-party-analytics-postgres` is dry-run by default, limits work to a
30-60 day window, counts only the current organization (legacy owner rows are
opt-in), and compares the scoped BigQuery count before any delete. It never
removes exception issues, session replay, public-key metadata, migration state,
or volume counters. A write also requires a completed BigQuery cutover, the
exact `PURGE_FIRST_PARTY_POSTGRES_EVENTS` confirmation, normal action approval,
and parity unless `allowUncopiedEvents=true` is explicitly accepted.

The checkpoint file contains cursors and counts, not event payloads or
credentials. A v1 checkpoint is upgraded in place with the bounded source
window and event filter while retaining its cursor and copied counts. A short
page triggers a fresh high-water check so rows written
while the worker is running are included. A partial BigQuery acknowledgement
does not advance the cursor; retry it promptly, or run an insertId-deduplication
or `MERGE` pass on the target table before finalizing.

Before finalization, quiesce the source event writes and verify the final
high-water marks. The `--owner-email` and `--org-id` values are trusted operator
inputs, so execution is limited to the approved production operator and the
two explicit environment gates. Then use the separate `--finalize` command
with both gates below. The command rechecks the source high-water marks before
marking the durable job complete; the normal migration action's approval gate
still controls cutover:

```bash
AGENT_NATIVE_ANALYTICS_BIGQUERY_BACKFILL_FINALIZE_ALLOW=1 \
AGENT_NATIVE_ANALYTICS_BIGQUERY_BACKFILL_QUIESCENT=1 \
pnpm backfill:first-party-bigquery \
  --finalize \
  --owner-email=<owner-email> \
  --org-id=<org-id>
```

Do not delete a lock file until the owning process has been verified stopped.

## TypeScript Everywhere

All code in this project must be TypeScript (`.ts`). Never create `.js`, `.cjs`, or `.mjs` files. Node 22+ runs `.ts` files natively, so no compilation step is needed for scripts. Use ESM imports (`import`), not CommonJS (`require`).

## Code Comments Policy

- Do not add unnecessary comments. Only comment complex logic that isn't self-evident.
- Never delete existing comments. Update them if your change makes them inaccurate.

## Extensions (Framework Feature)

The framework provides **Extensions** — mini sandboxed Alpine.js apps that run inside iframes. Extensions let users (or the agent) create interactive widgets, dashboards, and utilities without modifying the app's source code. They appear in the sidebar under an "Extensions" section. (Distinct from LLM tools — the function-calling primitives the agent invokes.)

- **Creating extensions**: Via the sidebar "+" button, agent chat, or `POST /_agent-native/extensions`
- **API calls**: Extensions use `extensionFetch()` (legacy alias `toolFetch`) which proxies requests through the server with `${keys.NAME}` secret injection
- **Styling**: Extensions inherit the main app's Tailwind v4 theme automatically
- **Sharing**: Private by default, shareable with org or specific users (same model as other ownable resources)
- **Security**: Iframe sandbox + CSP + SSRF protection on the proxy

See the `extensions` skill in `.agents/skills/extensions/SKILL.md` for full implementation details.
