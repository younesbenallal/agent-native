# Tracked Events Catalog

Events tracked by application instrumentation and stored in the configured application events table. The default BigQuery table is `analytics.events_partitioned`; deployments can override it with `ANALYTICS_BIGQUERY_EVENTS_TABLE`.

## Event Categories (`event` column)

| Event         | Description                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `signup`      | User completes signup                         |
| `pageView`    | User views a page in the app                  |
| `impression`  | User sees a UI element (content, modal, etc.) |
| `interaction` | User interacts with a UI element              |

## Common Event Names (`name` column)

### Signup & Onboarding

- `signup` — New user registration
- `onboarding: cli auth` — User visits CLI auth page
- `authorize cli` — User authorizes CLI/plugin access

### Organization & Invitations

- `invite_sent` — An owner/admin sends an org invitation. Properties: `app`,
  `template` (the app slug), `org_id`, `role` (`admin` or `member`). Tracked
  under the inviter's `userId` (their email).
- `invite_accepted` — A pending invitation is accepted — via the
  accept-invitation route, or reconciled automatically on signup, SSO, or email
  verification. Domain auto-join adds members directly and emits no invite
  event. Properties: `app`, `template`, `org_id`,
  `role` (`admin` or `member`), `federated` (boolean), and `referrer_user` —
  the inviter's Better Auth user id, resolved from the invitation's
  `invited_by` email and included only when that lookup succeeds; omitted
  entirely when it can't be resolved. The invitee has no identity property of
  their own on this event — it flows only through the event's `userId` (the
  invitee's email), not through a `data` field.

### Agent Chat / AI

- `agent chat message submitted` — User sends an agent chat message
- `agent chat message received` — AI responds
- `agent chat code applied` — AI-generated code applied to project
- `$ai_generation` — One instrumented agent-loop LLM generation emitted through
  server-side tracking. Properties include `$ai_trace_id`, `$ai_session_id`,
  `$ai_model`, `$ai_provider`, `$ai_input_tokens`, `$ai_output_tokens`,
  `$ai_latency`, `$ai_total_cost_usd`, `run_id`, `thread_id`,
  `cost_cents_x100`, `duration_ms`, `tool_calls`, `status`, `$ai_http_status`,
  and error fields. `$ai_http_status` is 200 on a call that streamed to
  completion and the provider's status on one that failed; it is absent when
  the failure carried no status, so an unclassifiable transport drop is never
  reported as a known rejection.
  `$ai_latency` is model time in seconds; `duration_ms` is the full run in
  milliseconds, and the two differ by the time spent in tools.
  A bounded `tools` array records only tool names, relative start times,
  durations, statuses, and coarse error classes; interrupted tools and failed
  runs remain visible, and `tools_truncated` marks runs above the 50-entry cap.
  Delegated runs also include protocol, caller, task, parent-run, and
  parent-turn linkage. Prompt, argument, result, and response content are excluded.

### Content Editing

- `document_created` — New content document created
- `ai_refine_used` — AI-assisted content refinement applied

There is no general-purpose publish event for the normal editor flow. A
`"published"` event exists only for the narrow Builder-CMS push-back
integration, gated on `result.executed`.

### Knowledge Base (Brain)

- `knowledge_created` — A new knowledge entry is saved; not emitted on an
  update to an existing entry. Properties: `app_name`, `template_name` (both
  `"brain"`), `output_id` (the knowledge row id), `output_type` (always
  `"knowledge"`), `kind` (defaults to `"fact"`), `publish_tier`. Tracked
  under the author's `userId` (their email).

### Traffic

- `pageView` or `pageview` events with `url` showing which app pages are visited, when the configured event source records page traffic

## Data Properties (in the `data` JSON blob)

Every event includes these base properties by default (from `track.function.ts`):

- `userId` — Firebase UID
- `userEmail` — User email
- `organizationId` — Current space ID
- `rootOrganizationId` — Parent org ID
- `rootOrgName` — Parent org name
- `kind` — Org kind (`cms`, `shopify`)
- `organizationType` — `space` or `root`
- `userLoggedIn` — Boolean
- `accountType` — `shopify` or `cms`

### Session & Visitor

- `sessionId` — App session ID

- `sessionUrl` — FullStory session URL

### Attribution
