  Shared conventions for a multi-app Agent-Native workspace: finding
  version-matched framework docs and source, shared vs app-owned code, file and
  blob storage, env and secrets, agent scratch files, and Dispatch Resources.
  Use when working across workspace apps, storing files or credentials, or
  looking up framework APIs.

# Workspace Conventions

The long-form detail behind the workspace `AGENTS.md` core rules. Read this
before adding shared code, storing files or secrets, creating workspace
resources, or looking up framework APIs.

## Framework Docs Lookup

Read `agent-native-docs` for the lookup workflow (`framework-search` first, then
the focused `docs-search` / `source-search` readers, and the `rg` fallback).

The workspace-specific slugs it does not list are `workspace` and
`multi-app-workspace`. Feature flags and other specialized workflows are
optional; read their skill only when the app uses them. Use package docs for framework APIs,
the package corpus for reusable framework/template patterns, and this
`AGENTS.md` plus `.agents/skills/` for workspace-specific conventions.

Before building common workspace or agent UI, read `agent-native-toolkit` to
inventory existing public kits and installed package seams. Read
`customizing-agent-native` before adapting shared UI. Use the supported
ladder: configure → compose → eject the smallest unit → propose a shared seam.
Preview before `--apply`, commit `agent-native.ejections.json`, and never edit
`node_modules` or eject protected runtime contracts.

## Shared Conventions

- All AI/LLM behavior goes through the app's agent chat. UI and server code
  must not call model providers, AI SDK `generateText()` / `streamText()`, or
  other inline LLM APIs directly. Use `sendToAgentChat()` for local app-agent
  work, including hidden `context` and `submit: false` prefill/review flows.
  Keep actions deterministic and focused. If a workflow is framed as research,
  analysis, generation, recommendation, or synthesis, let the agent
  orchestrate provider/data actions in the open AgentSidebar instead of hiding
  the work in one opaque action or a separate follow-up textbox.
  Only use `useAgentChatContext`, `setAgentChatContextItem`,
  `listAgentChatContext`, `removeAgentChatContextItem`, and
  `clearAgentChatContext` when UI needs two-way sync with staged context chips.
  Read `.agents/skills/delegate-to-agent/SKILL.md` before building agent-driven
  UI or "AI" features.
- Put shared code in `packages/shared` only when multiple apps need it.
- Keep app-specific screens, actions, state, and skills inside `apps/<app>`.
- SQL is for structured records, metadata, references, and searchable text. Store
  large files/blob payloads (base64, `data:` URLs, images, video/audio, PDFs,
  ZIPs, screenshots, thumbnails, session replay chunks) in configured file/blob
  storage and persist only URLs, ids, or handles.
- Store shared runtime configuration in the workspace root `.env`; use
  `apps/<app>/.env` only for app-specific overrides. For public app behavior,
  prefer the default in `agent-native.config.ts` and use the deterministic
  `AGENT_NATIVE_CONFIG_<UPPER_SNAKE_PATH>` alias only when a non-secret value
  needs a deployment override. Never hardcode API keys,
  tokens, webhook URLs, signing secrets, private Builder/internal data, customer
  data, or credential-looking literals in source, docs, prompts, fixtures,
  application state, action responses, or generated app content. Use
  secrets/OAuth/runtime configuration and obvious placeholders in examples.
- Each app deploys its own `/*` page function, and that function ships whatever
  the app's server bundle depends on — including a dependency only a background
  job uses. Before an app takes on a heavy runtime (headless browser, ffmpeg,
  media processing, ML), read `.agents/skills/performance/SKILL.md` §9 and keep
  that work in a background function or job. A dependency belonging to one app
  does not belong in `packages/shared`.
- Prefer framework defaults until the workspace has a real custom rule,
  component, plugin, action, or skill to share.
- Keep the Workspace files view for user-authored or user-requested resources.
  Agents may create hidden `agent_scratch` resources for temporary working
  notes, scripts, task plans, or intermediate outputs, but should promote them
  to normal workspace visibility only when the user explicitly asks to keep or
  manage the file.
- Runtime-editable global resources can be managed from Dispatch Resources.
  Use `AGENTS.md` or `instructions/<slug>.md` for always-on guardrails,
  `skills/<slug>/SKILL.md` for workspace skills, `context/<slug>.md` for
  personas/positioning/messaging/company facts/brand guidelines, and
  `agents/<slug>.md` for custom agent profiles. Scope them to All apps when
  every workspace app should inherit them. All-app resources are inherited at
  runtime; do not copy or sync them into individual apps.
