    "Query the built-in first-party Analytics source: events recorded through this app's analytics collector endpoint (/track), compact daily rollups updated transactionally with new ingest, identifiable user-day rollups, and session replay summaries recorded through /api/analytics/replay. This source does not require an external provider connection. Use it for questions about app/site traffic, product events, template/app usage, conversions, session recordings, LLM/agent observability, model cost, token volume, latency, and other first-party data collected by this analytics app. Use source-specific actions such as BigQuery, GA4, Mixpanel, PostHog, or Amplitude when the user asks for those sources or the relevant data lives there. SQL may read analytics_events, analytics_event_daily_rollups, analytics_user_days, and session_recordings; session_replay_chunks is intentionally unavailable, and reads are automatically scoped to the current user/org. Prefer analytics_event_daily_rollups for event counts and analytics_user_days for active-user or retention questions. On the Builder.io production organization after the explicit BigQuery cutover, event and rollup reads use partitioned BigQuery tables/views while session_recordings remains in the SQL store; cross-backend joins are not supported. Before a large or historical query, call get-first-party-analytics-health and use a configured external backend when it recommends one: BigQuery supports warehouse SQL and historical analysis, while Amplitude supports product analytics, funnels, and retention. Connecting a backend does not automatically reroute /track events or copy existing Neon events; the migration action performs that explicit prepare, backfill, and cutover sequence. Aggregate, project only needed columns, use bounded recent drill-downs, and add a LIMIT for raw or high-cardinality reads; do not issue an unbounded raw-event scan or paginate a large cohort. An explicit all-time or lifetime request remains all-time, so do not invent a default lower time bound. Safe scoped results are cached for up to five minutes for this agent action. analytics_events columns include event_name, timestamp, event_date, user_id, anonymous_id, user_key, session_id, app, template, signed_in, url, path, hostname, referrer, properties, and context. analytics_event_daily_rollups columns include tenant_key, owner_email, org_id, event_date, event_name, app, template, and event_count. analytics_user_days columns include tenant_key, owner_email, org_id, event_date, and user_key. LLM observability events use event_name = '$ai_generation'; useful properties include $ai_trace_id/run_id, $ai_session_id/thread_id, $ai_model/model, $ai_provider/provider, $ai_input_tokens/input_tokens, $ai_output_tokens/output_tokens, cache_read_tokens, cache_write_tokens, cost_cents_x100, $ai_total_cost_usd/cost_usd, duration_ms (full run, milliseconds), $ai_latency (model time in seconds, run minus tool time), status, tool_calls, successful_tools, failed_tools, tools, tools_truncated, delegated, delegation_protocol, caller_app, delegation_task_id, a2a_task_id, parent_run_id, parent_turn_id, and error_message/$ai_error. Agent Teams child runs use delegation_protocol = 'agent-team' and retain their own run_id while linking to the launching run through parent_run_id. The bounded tools array contains names, relative start times, durations, statuses, and coarse error classes only, never args or results; failed runs and interrupted tools remain queryable. session_recordings columns include id, session_id, user_id, anonymous_id, user_key, started_at, ended_at, duration_ms, chunk_count, event_count, page_count, error_count, rage_click_count, app, template, status, first_url, last_url, path, hostname, referrer, and metadata.",
