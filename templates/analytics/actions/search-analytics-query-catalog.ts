This is the analytics equivalent of grepping for similar code: one bounded call searches accessible saved dashboard names, chart titles/descriptions/queries, shipped dashboard patterns, and data-dictionary definitions. The result reports `searchedDashboardCount`, `dashboardSearchTruncated`, `dashboardSearchStatus`, `searchedDictionaryEntryCount`, `dictionarySearchTruncated`, and `dictionarySearchStatus`. If dashboard search is truncated or unavailable and no close saved-dashboard match appears, use `search-dashboard-references` with focused terms; if dictionary search is truncated, partial, or unavailable and no close definition appears, use `list-data-dictionary` with focused terms before concluding there is no saved example. Use it first for an ordinary metric lookup unless the user supplied an exact source and query. Prefer the highest-trust close match, adapt its saved query only for the requested filters/time window, run one authoritative source query, and stop on success. Do not separately list every dashboard or scan provider catalogs after a strong match.",
