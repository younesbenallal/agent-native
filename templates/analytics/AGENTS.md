# Analytics — Agent Guide

Analytics is an agent-native BI workspace for sources, queries, dashboards,
charts, and warehouse integrations; dashboards are canonical and legacy
analyses remain readable.

## Skills

Read the relevant skill before deeper work:

- `data-querying` for source inspection, SQL generation, result handling, and
  `/chart` embeds; `bigquery`, `hubspot`, `gong`, `prometheus` for provider
  specifics.
- `account-health` for named customer health, QBR, renewal, contract usage,
  identity, and product adoption.
- `cross-source-analysis` for questions spanning sources (identity stitching,
  de-duplication).
- `dashboard-management` for dashboard/panel storage, layout, extensions,
  mutation and sharing.
- `adhoc-analysis` for one-off answers; `analysis-workspace` for large work and
  CSV/XLSX exports.
- `provider-api` and `data-programs` for the escape hatch and durable,
  refreshable data sources.
- `creative-context` for governed contexts and immutable dashboard revisions.
- `admin-surfaces` for the `/agents` fleet flags, usage audit, and connected DBs.

## How To Answer A Data Question

1. **Use the closest query example.** For a metric question, adapt a relevant
   preloaded reference; if none fits, call `search-analytics-query-catalog`.
   For dashboard replication or adaptation, call `search-dashboard-references`
   first and inspect each result with `get-sql-dashboard` or
   `get-explorer-dashboard` by its `kind`. A match is context, not live data.
   Adapt the closest saved SQL to the requested filters/window, run it once,
   and stop. Prefer a current `certified` dashboard; a favorite is a weaker
   relevance signal. Certification becomes stale after a dashboard edit.
2. **One bounded call.** List/filter/count/cohort questions are one SQL statement
   or one server-side `run-code` script; never page or fan out per item.
3. **Escalate on a miss.** If the catalog has no usable result, make one discovery
   pass (`list-data-dictionary`, `search-bigquery-schema`, `data-source-status`),
   then query; don't cross-check or add unasked breakdowns.
4. **Answer in chat.** Give a concise, grounded answer; return a table only
   when the user asks to see query rows, and for >50 rows state the total and
   top rows.
   For `query-agent-native-analytics`, set `showTable: true` only when the user
   explicitly asks to see query rows; one-cell numeric results render as a
   compact Analysis result card.
5. **Chunk only reading.** Group 5-10 only for 30+ qualitative items when a query
   cannot answer; don't chunk queryable questions. See `adhoc-analysis`.

State confidence, never a dead end: cite the dashboard or query used (note
certified ones); label figures "Unverified" when no live query ran.

## Core Rules

- UI feedback: target 100 ms, never exceed 400 ms; acknowledge before network work.
- A sibling app sends natural-language or shaped input over A2A, never SQL; this
  app owns schema, source selection, and tools. Prefer natural-language
  delegation; shaped reads are stable contracts.
- Analytics owns first-party product usage, app/template events, agent-native
  signups, conversions, and other curated product metrics. Answer sibling-app
  delegations with the built-in source and query catalog; sibling agents should
  send a natural-language question, never SQL.
- Delegation: choose defaults; label partial.
- Never invent data or source semantics; include source, window, filters, sample
  size, join method, and caveats.
- Use actions for data and sharing; don't bypass ownable-resource access checks
  with raw SQL.
- Provider actions are bounded shortcuts, not limits. For broad or
  absence-sensitive Gong work, stage raw API data and use `query-staged-dataset`
  or a Data Program; see `provider-api`, `data-programs`, and `gong` for secure
  provider and hosted-endpoint boundaries.
- Create dashboards or saved artifacts only when asked; keep them focused and
  never modify existing dashboards without direction.
- For named account/deal deep dives, call `account-deep-dive` first.
- For named account health, read `account-health` before querying.
- When the user challenges coverage or asks why records are missing, rerun from
  the source cohort and include the updated answer directly — never claim a
  revision you didn't produce.
- Never cite the public `demo` source as real analytics evidence unless asked.
- Store large payloads in file/blob storage, never SQL or app state. Persist
  only URLs, ids, or handles.
- Never hardcode API keys, tokens, webhook URLs, secrets, private Builder data,
  or customer data. Use secrets/OAuth and obvious placeholders in examples.
- For external integrations, inspect the workspace/provider connection catalog first; reuse its scoped resolver.
- External MCP callers: use cataloged direct actions for bounded reads and
  allowlisted mutations. Use `ask_app` for interpretation, source selection,
  multi-step work, unavailable actions, or unsupported writes.
- Reports/alerts use SQL actions; cap at five recipients.

## Application State

- `navigation` exposes the current dashboard, analysis, source, chart, and
  selection. `navigate` moves the user between supported Analytics surfaces,
  `"sessions"`, `"monitoring"`, and `"agents"`. Use `view-screen` when the
  active context is unclear.
- Clicking a panel stages it as a chat context chip and writes `selected-object`
  with `type="dashboard-panel"`. Read `dashboard-management` for the
  `/dashboards` overview and folder actions.

## Shared UI

Before building common workspace or agent UI, read `agent-native-toolkit`; read
`customizing-agent-native` before adapting shared UI.
