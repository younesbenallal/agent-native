# Real-Time Sync

## Rule

The UI stays in sync with agent/script changes through `useDbSync()`. On a long-lived host, in-process writes stream over `/_agent-native/events` first and `/_agent-native/poll` is the cross-process fallback. On a production serverless host (Netlify, Lambda, Vercel functions), the app's own `/_agent-native/events` is not the fast path — the server answers a poll-live-aware client with an immediate 204 instead of holding the connection, and `/_agent-native/poll` carries all sync there at the SAME cadence sync would otherwise use, unless the app has opted in to the Hosted Realtime Sync Gateway (see `real-time-collaboration.mdx#hosted-gateway`), which streams from its own long-lived process instead. When the agent writes to the database, the UI detects the change and updates automatically — no manual refresh needed.

## Why

The agent modifies data in SQL, but the UI runs in the browser. SSE bridges same-process writes immediately; polling bridges anything SSE cannot see, such as another serverless invocation, cron job, or external script. Every visible write increments a version counter, `useDbSync()` receives the change, and React Query invalidates the relevant caches. This is what makes database writes feel real-time without relying on aggressive polling.

On serverless, the app's own SSE stream cannot deliver this at all: one function instance serves one request at a time, so the instance holding the stream can never observe a write made by a different invocation's in-process emitter — and holding the connection open just occupies that instance until the platform kills it, which resets the execution environment and makes `EventSource` reconnect into a fresh cold container. The server detects a production serverless invocation (`isProductionServerlessFunctionRuntime()` — excludes `netlify dev`'s long-lived `NETLIFY_LOCAL` server) from a client that opted in (the `poll_live=1` query param a current bundle appends to its own `/_agent-native/events` connect URL) and answers with an immediate 204 instead — `EventSource` treats any non-200 status as terminal and does not auto-reconnect, so 204 is the conventional way to say "stop". A request without that param (an older, already-open tab) keeps streaming until it reloads, so this never yanks the live channel out from under a bundle that doesn't know to fall back.

The client transport treats that 204 as a refusal that happened before the stream ever opened, distinct from a network blip on an open stream: it reports the `poll-live` capability to every subscriber (`DeckContext`, `collab/client.ts`, and anything else on `subscribeSyncEvents`'s `onSseStateChange`) so they keep their normal push-connected cadence instead of racing `/poll` under a "live channel down" fallback that would never get fresher — a Lambda SSE stream never carried cross-instance writes either, so there is no freshness to trade the extra load for. It then retries on a long backoff (5 minutes, doubling to a 60-minute cap, reset on a successful open) instead of a tight reconnect loop or a permanent latch — a long-lived host that refused a first connect for an unrelated reason (session not ready yet, a proxy restarting) still recovers, just slower than an ordinary network blip. This is expected, not a bug — don't try to force SSE on there.

## How It Works

1. **Server** increments a version counter on every database write. On a long-lived host, in-process events stream through the authenticated `/_agent-native/events` endpoint; on a production serverless host, that endpoint answers 204 without holding the invocation for a request whose client opted in via `poll_live=1`, and otherwise streams as before.

2. **Client** listens for sync events and updates per-source change counters:

   ```ts
   import { useDbSync } from "@agent-native/core/client/hooks";
   useDbSync({ queryClient });
   ```

   For each non-own event, `useDbSync` bumps a per-source counter (e.g. `dashboards`, `analyses`, `settings`, `action`) and invalidates a small fixed list of framework-internal prefixes (`["action"]`, `["app-state"]`, `["__set_url__"]`, etc.). It does **not** blanket-invalidate templates' own data queries — that caused request storms in production. A successful mutating action refreshes active `useActionQuery` observers under the `["action"]` prefix. Browser actions carry a tab id so their originating tab ignores the sync echo while other tabs refresh. Legacy apps can opt into broader compatibility with `actionInvalidatePredicate`, but first-party apps should use action-backed or source-versioned query keys. Idle fallback polling runs once per minute; active agent work temporarily uses the faster cadence.

3. **Templates fold per-source counters into their query keys.** This is the pattern that makes "agent writes show up without a manual refresh" reliable:

   ```ts
   import { useChangeVersion } from "@agent-native/core/client/hooks";
   import { useQuery } from "@tanstack/react-query";

   const v = useChangeVersion("dashboards");
   const dashboard = useQuery({
     queryKey: ["dashboard", id, v],
     queryFn: () => fetchDashboard(id),
     placeholderData: (prev) => prev, // no flicker on refetch
   });
   ```

   When the agent writes (`update-dashboard` action → server emits `source: "dashboards"`), the counter advances, the queryKey changes, and React Query refetches that one query. The old data stays on screen during the refetch thanks to `placeholderData`.

   For list/sidebar queries, use the same pattern — pass the counter into the queryKey of every list query you want to keep fresh.

4. **Fallback** polling calls `/_agent-native/poll?since=N`. It polls every 2 seconds only while an agent run is in flight; otherwise it idles at 60 seconds whether or not SSE is connected (`SSE_FALLBACK_INTERVAL_MS` and `IDLE_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`, both 60 s). A hidden tab polls no faster than every 10 seconds (`HIDDEN_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`). Polling is the universal serverless fallback: new framework writes are read from the durable `sync_events` log, while the older DB timestamp scan remains as a slower safety net for direct SQL writes and older processes.

5. When the agent writes to the database, the version increments, SSE/polling detects it, and React Query refetches the affected queries.

## Don't

- Don't create manual polling loops — `useDbSync()` handles SSE plus fallback polling
- Don't create your own fetch-based polling alongside `useDbSync` — use the `onEvent` callback for custom handling
- Don't open your own `EventSource` to `/_agent-native/events`. A tab must hold exactly ONE SSE connection no matter how many features listen — extra streams eat the browser's per-origin connection budget and can starve ordinary data fetches (worst on HTTP/1.1 dev servers). Subscribe to the shared transport instead:

  ```ts
  import { subscribeSyncEvents } from "@agent-native/core/client/hooks";

  const unsubscribe = subscribeSyncEvents({
    onEvents: (events) => {
      // filter by event.source and handle push-style updates
    },
    // Optional: relax your own fallback cadence while push is healthy, or
    // while `capabilities` reports `poll-live` (production serverless: SSE
    // is refused but /poll carries the same load at the normal cadence —
    // see REALTIME_CAP_POLL_LIVE in realtime-protocol.ts).
    onSseStateChange: (connected, capabilities) => {},
  });
  ```

  `useDbSync` and every `subscribeSyncEvents` subscriber share one `EventSource` and one fallback poll loop per tab — this is how collaborative documents receive doc updates and cursor/awareness events. Hidden tabs keep that shared transport alive by default: SSE stays connected and active fallback polling relaxes to a 10-second floor (idle polling remains once per minute). Pass `pauseWhenHidden: true` only for a consumer that explicitly must stop all hidden-tab sync.

## Which sources to depend on

Common sources you'll fold into query keys:

| Source            | Bumped by                                                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `action`          | The agent runner after every successful mutating action tool call           |
| `app-state`       | Writes to `application_state` (navigation, selections, ephemeral UI state)  |
| `settings`        | Writes to the `settings` table                                              |
| `dashboards`      | Dashboard CRUD via `upsertDashboard` / `archiveDashboard` etc.              |
| `analyses`        | Analysis CRUD                                                               |
| `extensions`      | Extension CRUD                                                              |
| `collab`          | Yjs collaborative-doc updates                                               |
| `screen-refresh`  | Explicit `refresh-screen` agent tool call                                   |

If a query reads data the agent can mutate via more than one path, depend on multiple sources with `useChangeVersions`:

```ts
const v = useChangeVersions(["dashboards", "action"]);
useQuery({ queryKey: ["dashboard", id, v], ... });
```

`useChangeVersions` returns a single integer that advances whenever any of the listed sources advance.

## Tuning refetch behavior

To prevent cache thrashing during rapid agent writes, set `staleTime` on your queries:

```ts
useQuery({
  queryKey: ["items"],
  queryFn: fetchItems,
  staleTime: 2000, // don't refetch within 2 seconds
});
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                            | Check                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| UI not updating after agent writes | Is `useDbSync` called with the correct `queryClient`? Does the affected query have an active observer?         |
| Poll endpoint not responding       | Is `/_agent-native/poll` accessible? Is the server running?                                                    |
| SSE not connecting                 | On a production serverless deploy this is expected — the server refuses the stream on purpose (see Why) and the client reports `poll-live` so cadence stays normal. Otherwise: is `/_agent-native/events` accessible and authenticated? Polling should still keep the UI fresh as fallback.   |
| High CPU / event storms            | Use targeted source keys, settle bursty list counters, and avoid broad action invalidation.                   |

## Jitter Prevention

When the agent writes to application-state via script helpers (`writeAppState`, `deleteAppState`), the write is automatically tagged with `requestSource: "agent"`. This prevents the UI from overwriting active user edits when it receives the change event.

### How it works

1. **Agent writes** are tagged: the script helpers in `@agent-native/core/application-state` pass `{ requestSource: "agent" }` to the store.
2. **UI writes** are tagged: templates send a per-tab ID via the `X-Request-Source` header on PUT/DELETE requests to application-state endpoints.
3. **Sync filters**: `useDbSync()` accepts an `ignoreSource` option. The UI passes its own tab ID so it ignores events from its own writes — but still picks up events from agents, other tabs, and scripts.

### Template setup

```ts
// app/lib/tab-id.ts — already scaffolded, do not redefine
import { getBrowserTabId } from "@agent-native/core/client/hooks";
export const TAB_ID = getBrowserTabId();

// app/root.tsx
import { TAB_ID } from "@/lib/tab-id";

useDbSync({
  queryClient,
  ignoreSource: TAB_ID,
});
```

`getBrowserTabId()` is the id the server resolves tab-scoped `application_state` and WebMCP calls against — see `context-awareness`.

The `use-navigation-state.ts` hook sends the same `TAB_ID` in the `X-Request-Source` header when writing navigation state, so the tab that wrote the state does not refetch it.

### Why this matters

Without jitter prevention, a cycle occurs: the UI writes state, sync detects the change, the UI refetches and re-renders, potentially overwriting what the user is actively editing. With `ignoreSource`, the UI only reacts to changes from other sources (agent scripts, other browser tabs, other users).

## Action Routes and Live Sync

Actions work with the same sync system. When a mutating action writes to the database, the version counter increments and `useDbSync` picks up the change. Frontend mutations via `useActionMutation` automatically invalidate `["action"]` query keys on success, triggering refetches of `useActionQuery` hooks. Client components should call actions through those hooks, not with raw action-route fetches.

For custom apps, the best out-of-the-box path is:

1. Put read actions in `actions/` with `defineAction({ http: { method: "GET" } })`.
2. Put write actions in `actions/` with the default POST/PUT/DELETE behavior.
3. Call reads from React with `useActionQuery` and writes with `useActionMutation`.

This avoids duplicate `/api/*` JSON CRUD routes and makes agent-created records show up automatically. Raw `useQuery` can still work, but it should include `useChangeVersions(["action", "<domain-source>"])` in the query key for targeted refreshes.

### Auto-emit on mutating actions

The framework emits a change event with `source: "action"` whenever any non-read-only action runs to completion — whether called via HTTP (`/_agent-native/actions/:name`) or as an agent tool call. Read-only actions (`http: { method: "GET" }` or explicit `readOnly: true`) are skipped.

This means UIs don't need the agent to remember to call `refresh-screen` after every mutation. A listener like this will refresh after any mutating agent call:

```ts
useDbSync({
  queryClient,
  ignoreSource: TAB_ID,
  onEvent: (data) => {
    if (data.requestSource === TAB_ID) return;
    // Invalidate all useActionQuery caches so list-*, get-*, etc. refetch
    queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["action"] });
  },
});
```

`refresh-screen` remains available for unusual cases — e.g. the agent mutated data via a path the framework can't see (external system the app mirrors), or the agent wants to pass a `scope` hint for narrower invalidation.

## Keeping Stateful Components In Sync

The `useChangeVersion` / `useActionQuery` pattern above keeps the **query layer** fresh. But components that copy a server value into local React state still go stale on agent edits — refetching the query updates the prop, yet the local copy never re-adopts it. This is a recurring bug.

**Never do this** for a value the agent can mutate:

```ts
// BUG: `title` is captured once and never re-reads the prop.
const [title, setTitle] = useState(props.title);
```

When the agent renames the record, the query refetches, `props.title` updates, but the input still shows the stale value until the component remounts.

**Derived-state surfaces (form fields, inline editors, popovers): use `useReconciledState`.** It re-adopts the authoritative external value when it changes, except while the user is actively editing that field — so agent mutations show up live without clobbering in-progress typing:

```ts
import { useReconciledState } from "@agent-native/core/client/hooks";

// `active` = true while the user is editing this field (focused / dirty).
const [title, setTitle] = useReconciledState(props.title, { active: isEditing });
```

**Collaborative rich-text editors are different** — they don't copy a value into `useState`. They reconcile authoritative SQL content into a shared Y.Doc under an `updatedAt` gate with lead-client election. See `real-time-collab` → "Agent edits as a real-time peer editor". Don't reach for `useReconciledState` for a Yjs-backed editor.

| Surface | Keep it fresh with |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| React Query reads | `useChangeVersion` / `useActionQuery` (above) |
| Local edit state copied from a server value (inputs, popovers, inline editors) | `useReconciledState(externalValue, { active })` |
| Collaborative rich-text editor (Yjs) | `updatedAt`-gated reconcile + `isReconcileLeadClient` — see `real-time-collab` |

## Granular server-side merge for non-body fields

For structured documents (slide decks, form builders, design files) where the
Yjs body collab would cause LWW conflicts at the container level, pair the
change-sync `updatedAt` bump with a **granular server-side merge action** that
accepts targeted per-item operations (add/patch/delete/reorder). Concurrent
edits to different items both survive at the action level; the `collab` source
version bump then propagates the merged state to all open clients. See
`real-time-collab` for the pattern and examples.
