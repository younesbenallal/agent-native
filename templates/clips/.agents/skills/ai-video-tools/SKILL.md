  All AI features in Clips — titles, summaries, chapters, tags, filler-word
  removal — delegate to the agent chat via sendToAgentChat except the narrow
  media pipeline path: transcription. Use when adding any
  AI-powered feature.

# AI Video Tools

## Rule

Every AI feature in Clips goes through the agent chat unless it is the narrow media-pipeline exception below. The UI and server should not add broad shadow agents or inline chat workflows. **Exception:** transcription. Transcription takes audio, not prompts — the `request-transcript` action calls the transcription API directly. Provider priority for transcription: **native** first (browser Web Speech API, desktop local Whisper/macOS SFSpeech when available, and desktop Web Speech fallback on non-mac, saved via `save-browser-transcript`, no key required) → **cloud fallback** when native text is missing: **Builder.io managed** Gemini (via `BUILDER_PRIVATE_KEY` or a connected Builder account, no extra key needed) → **Groq** `whisper-large-v3-turbo` via `GROQ_API_KEY` (fast, ~$0.04/hr). Clips never routes recording/meeting audio to OpenAI for transcription.

Builder.io is the primary setup path: it brings managed AI credits, object
storage, uploads, and transcription together. Bring-your-own-key setup belongs
in the agent sidebar's **API Keys & Connections** panel; Clips settings can
signpost that existing panel, but should not add a second key-management
surface.

## Why

The agent is already the user's primary interface — it has full project context, can chain tool calls, and can ask follow-up questions. Shadow LLM calls inside UI components create a second AI that doesn't know what the agent knows and can't coordinate with it. See the framework `delegate-to-agent` skill for the full argument.

## Features and how they delegate

| Feature                   | Trigger                                                                               | What the action does                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Include full video        | User toggles "Include full video" in the AI tools menu                                | `update-clips-ai-prefs --includeFullVideoInAi=true\|false` → stored in `clips-user-prefs`; default off |
| Default title             | Native/cloud transcript becomes ready and the recording still has an automatic title   | `regenerate-title --recordingId=<id> --includeSummary=true` tries the transcript-only Gemini fast path, keeps any local heuristic title replaceable, and queues a `generate-metadata` agent refinement that writes a specific title plus description. If Include full video is on, it always delegates so the agent watches the recording |
| Manual title suggestion   | User asks the agent "rename this"                                                     | Agent reads transcript and calls `update-recording --id=<id> --title=...`                             |
| Summary / description     | Transcript becomes ready, or user clicks "Summarize" / "Regenerate description"       | The automatic metadata handoff or `regenerate-summary` asks the agent to write `update-recording --description=...`. Existing user-authored descriptions are preserved. With Include full video, the agent must watch the clip, not transcript alone |
| Chapters                  | User clicks "Add chapters" or transcript > 3 minutes                                  | `generate-chapters --id=<id>` / `regenerate-chapters` → agent writes `chapters_json` (same full-video preference) |
| Tags                      | On upload complete                                                                    | `generate-ai-metadata --id=<id> --kind=tags` → agent inserts `recording_tags` rows                    |
| Filler-word removal       | User clicks "Remove ums and uhs"                                                      | `generate-filler-removal --id=<id>` → agent writes proposed cuts into `editor-draft` for user review  |
| Comment auto-reply        | User types "reply with …" in the agent chat                                           | agent calls `add-comment` directly                                                                    |
| **Transcription**         | On upload complete (automatic) + live during recording                                | `request-transcript` → native (Web Speech / macOS SFSpeech) first, then cloud fallback Builder.io managed Gemini → Groq; `save-browser-transcript` for instant Web Speech result — see "Transcription" section below |

## Include full video

Screen recordings often have thin or misleading audio ("real quick", "um this
thing"). Titles, descriptions, chapters, and workflow docs (PR / SOP / ticket /
email) are more accurate when the agent can **see** the UI, product names, and
on-screen text.

- Preference key: `includeFullVideoInAi` on user setting `clips-user-prefs`.
- UI: checkbox at the top of the recording-page **AI tools** dropdown (copy
  notes Gemini-only).
- Actions: `get-clips-ai-prefs`, `update-clips-ai-prefs`.
- **Gemini only:** sending / understanding the full recording video requires a
  Gemini model (Builder Gemini or `GEMINI_API_KEY`). Claude and OpenAI cannot
  ingest the MP4/WebM. When the preference is on, the AI-request bridge prefers
  Builder `gemini-3-5-flash` for that turn.
- When on, queued `clips-ai-request-*` messages include instructions to attach
  or upload the recording to Gemini when possible, otherwise use
  `get-recording-player-data` / `create-recording-agent-link` and follow
  recommended frames / the frame API across the timeline — not transcript only.
- Default title generation also honors this: `regenerate-title` skips the
  transcript-only Gemini cleanup path and always queues the agent. Automatic
  post-transcription work uses one `generate-metadata` request so title and
  description are not competing application-state entries.

Do not invent a parallel "video LLM" path in the UI. Keep the preference on the
shared user-prefs object and keep delegation through the agent chat.

## The delegation pattern

From an action, kick work over to the agent chat in **background mode** so the user doesn't see a new message bubble mid-playback:

```ts
import { defineAction, sendToAgentChat } from "@agent-native/core";
import { z } from "zod";
import { getRecordingOrThrow } from "../server/lib/recordings.js";

export default defineAction({
  description:
    "Generate AI metadata for a recording. Delegates to the agent chat in the background so it can use its full toolchain.",
  schema: z.object({
    id: z.string(),
    kind: z
      .string()
      .default("title,summary")
      .describe("Comma-separated: title, summary, tags"),
  }),
  run: async ({ id, kind }) => {
    const rec = await getRecordingOrThrow(id);
    const kinds = kind.split(",").map((s) => s.trim());

    await sendToAgentChat({
      background: true,
      message: `Generate ${kinds.join(" + ")} for recording "${rec.title}" (${id}). Read the transcript via \`get-transcript --id=${id}\` and write results via \`update-recording --id=${id} --title=... --description=...\`.`,
      context: {
        recordingId: id,
        title: rec.title,
        durationMs: rec.durationMs,
        kinds,
      },
      submit: true,
    });

    return { queued: true, kinds };
  },
});
```

Key rules:

- **`background: true`** — the request runs in a hidden agent thread. The user's main chat is untouched.
- **`context`** — structured data the agent gets but the user doesn't see. Keep it small — ids, titles, durations. Don't dump the whole transcript; the agent can fetch it via `get-transcript`.
- **`submit: true`** — auto-submit. These are routine, user-approved operations.
- **Never `await` the agent's response from an action.** Fire and forget. The agent will write results back via other actions (`update-recording`, `apply-edit`), and `refresh-signal` will push them to the UI.

For UI-triggered AI — **no wand, no sparkles, no robot icons** (all three are overplayed clichés for AI). Prefer plain text with a caret (`IconChevronDown`) on a dropdown, or a neutral verb icon like `IconBolt` only if an icon is truly needed. Call the same action via `useActionMutation`:

```tsx
const generate = useActionMutation("generate-ai-metadata");
<Button onClick={() => generate.mutate({ id: rec.id, kind: "title,summary" })}>
  Suggest
  <IconChevronDown className="ml-2 h-4 w-4" />
</Button>
```

## Media-pipeline exception

Transcription takes an audio file and returns text + segments. That's not a prompt/response LLM interaction, so it doesn't belong in the agent chat. `actions/request-transcript.ts` calls the transcription API directly.

**Provider priority:**

1. **Native (highest priority).** The browser's Web Speech API, desktop local Whisper/macOS SFSpeech when available, and desktop Web Speech fallback on non-mac run during recording and save results via `save-browser-transcript`. This gives an instant transcript with no API key when the local/browser recognizer is available. When `request-transcript` runs afterward, it preserves the ready native transcript and only falls back to a cloud provider if native text is missing.
2. **Cloud fallback — Builder.io managed (Gemini).** When a Builder account is connected (`BUILDER_PRIVATE_KEY` or per-user OAuth, no separate API key needed), `request-transcript` calls `transcribeWithBuilder()`, which routes audio to Builder.io's managed Gemini transcription. Returns text plus timestamped segments. Retry a failed transcript with `force: true`; pass `regenerate: true` to replace an existing ready transcript from the stored recording media. Regeneration keeps the prior ready transcript available if the new provider attempt fails.
3. **Cloud fallback — Groq Whisper.** `GROQ_API_KEY` → `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/audio/transcriptions`, model `whisper-large-v3-turbo`. Fast (~$0.04/hour of audio) Whisper-compatible speech-to-text used when Builder is unavailable.

The transcript included by `view-screen` is only a bounded preview. When its
`previewTruncated` field is true, the preview may end mid-sentence and does not
show where transcription ended. Call `get-recording-player-data` before
judging completeness or quoting the full transcript.

Desktop native transcripts merge the microphone and system-audio streams while
removing overlapping duplicate speech and low-speech Whisper hallucinations. Keep
system audio enabled when the meeting audio comes from another app.

Native transcript first is a hard rule, not a preference: cloud transcription is
fallback-only for Clips recordings. Recording transcripts keep the native text as
captured; `request-transcript` does not run automatic cleanup. Never hide a
usable native transcript behind failed metadata work, and keep heuristic titles
replaceable until the agent refinement lands. The standalone `cleanup-transcript`
action remains available for explicit dictation, meeting, and agent workflows.

Clips never routes recording/meeting audio to OpenAI for transcription. (Groq's endpoint is OpenAI-_compatible_ in request shape only — the audio goes to Groq, not OpenAI.)

If no native transcript exists and no cloud fallback is available (no Builder connection and no Groq key), the action writes `status="failed"` so the UI can show a friendly prompt.

When a transcript becomes ready, `request-transcript` must await the metadata
handoff before its durable post-finalize worker returns. Do not leave
title/summary work as an unawaited promise in that worker:
serverless runtimes may freeze it immediately. A local heuristic title uses
`titleSource: "context"` so it remains a temporary UI fallback until the
`generate-metadata` agent request replaces it with a transcript-backed title.

If Builder transcription fails because credits are exhausted, explain that
Builder.io credits/upgrade or a Groq key are the supported speech-to-text
fallbacks. Generic OpenAI or Anthropic chat keys power chat, but they do not
transcribe Clips recordings.

### Secret registration

Builder transcription needs no app-specific key (the connected Builder.io account or `BUILDER_PRIVATE_KEY` carries the grant). The only transcription API key declared in `server/register-secrets.ts` is the optional Groq key, so it appears in the agent sidebar settings UI:

```ts
registerRequiredSecret({
  key: "GROQ_API_KEY",
  label: "Groq API Key (recommended)",
  description:
    "Fast speech-to-text fallback via Groq. Builder Gemini Flash-Lite is preferred when connected; Groq is used only when Builder/native transcription is unavailable.",
  docsUrl: "https://console.groq.com/keys",
  scope: "user",
  kind: "api-key",
  required: false,
});
```

It is not marked `required: true` — videos still upload and play without a Groq key when video storage is connected, since native transcription (and Builder when connected) already cover the common case. The API Keys & Connections panel surfaces it so the user can add the Groq fallback if they want it.

## AI setup, providers, and credits

AI setup must be visible and paid-account-backed. Lead with Builder.io Connect
for managed credits, object storage, uploads, and transcription. BYOK belongs in
the agent sidebar's API Keys & Connections panel; template settings may signpost
that panel but must not create a second credential vault.

Which provider powers what:

| Surface                                    | Provider                                  |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Agent chat                                 | Anthropic / OpenAI                        |
| Cleanup, titles, meeting notes             | Gemini (Builder-managed or BYOK)          |
| Recording transcripts                      | Native first, then Builder Gemini or Groq |
| Desktop voice dictation                    | Optional third-party speech provider      |

Any optional third-party speech provider is limited to desktop voice dictation
and is never used for recording transcripts.

Use `get-builder-credit-status` when the user asks whether Builder.io credit
limits are pausing backup transcription, transcript cleanup, summaries, or AI
title generation. Treat an exhausted status as an FYI and upgrade path, not an
app error: say so clearly and point the user at Builder.io credits/upgrade.
Native browser/macOS capture remains the first transcript source regardless.

## Bounded voice context

Dictation cleanup, clip title/cleanup, and meeting summaries should pass bounded
`voiceContext` to the shared cleanup/transcription path whenever active app
context, learned vocabulary, user notes, or AGENTS.md preferences are available.
Pass a bounded summary — never a whole transcript, document, or catalog.

## Live transcription during recording

The `useLiveTranscription` hook (from `@agent-native/core/client/transcription`) runs the browser's Web Speech API alongside any recording. It accumulates final transcript text in real time with no API key required. When the user stops, the client calls `save-browser-transcript` to persist the result. `request-transcript` preserves that native result and only falls back to cloud transcription when native text is missing.

A future pass could add server-side streaming transcription (Deepgram Nova-3 / AssemblyAI) via WebSocket for even higher quality real-time output — but the browser path already gives useful text from second zero.

## Don't

- Don't route Clips recording/meeting audio to OpenAI for transcription. The cloud fallback is Builder.io managed Gemini → Groq Whisper only; don't add an OpenAI transcription path or `import OpenAI from "openai"`.
- Don't `import Anthropic from "@anthropic-ai/sdk"` — the agent is already Claude.
- Don't build a "Clips AI" dialog that duplicates the agent chat. Use the agent chat.
- Don't render a robot, sparkle, or wand icon for AI affordances — all three are overplayed. Prefer plain text (or a neutral verb icon like `IconBolt`) for AI buttons.
- Don't dump entire transcripts into `sendToAgentChat` context. Pass the id; let the agent fetch.
- Don't `await` the agent's response from an action. Fire and forget; results arrive via other actions.
