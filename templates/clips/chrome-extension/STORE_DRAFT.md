Summary: Start Clips recordings from Chrome with optional redacted console and network diagnostics.

Category: Productivity

Description:

Agent-Native Clips lets you start a Clips recording from the Chrome toolbar and optionally attach browser diagnostics from the tab where you launched the recording.

Use it to:

- Record the current tab, a window, your full screen, or camera-only video.
- Include your camera bubble and microphone through the Clips recorder.
- Optionally capture redacted console logs and fetch/XHR request metadata.
- Keep browser recording permissions explicit: Chrome still asks before screen, camera, or microphone capture starts.

Diagnostics are bounded and redacted before they are saved. Clips does not collect request or response bodies, request headers, cookies, authorization headers, or full query values.

## Permission Justification

- `activeTab`: lets the toolbar action identify the user-selected active tab after the user clicks the extension.
- `scripting`: injects the on-page recording overlay (countdown, camera bubble, recording controls) into the active tab the user starts recording from, and removes it when the recording ends — via `chrome.scripting.executeScript` authorized by `activeTab`. Used only after the user starts a recording; never injected into background or arbitrary tabs, and no broad host permission is requested.
- `offscreen`: runs an offscreen document that performs the actual screen and camera capture via `getDisplayMedia`/`getUserMedia`, which a service worker cannot call directly.
- `debugger`: attaches to only the user-selected tab while a Clips recording is active, then detaches on stop/cancel. It is used to collect console messages, JavaScript exceptions, and fetch/XHR method, URL, status, timing, and failure metadata. It does not read request or response bodies.
- `storage`: remembers the user's default Clips app URL, capture source, camera toggle, and developer-log preference.

## Privacy Notes

- The extension only starts when the user clicks the toolbar button.
- The extension only sends diagnostics to the configured Clips app after the user starts and finishes a Clips recording.
- Developer logs are on by default and can be turned off from the popup or settings page.
- Network data is limited to fetch/XHR metadata and redacted URLs; headers and bodies are never captured.

## Review Notes

The extension opens `https://clips.agent-native.com/record` by default. Local development can point the settings page to a localhost Clips instance.

## Submission Artifact

Build the latest Chrome Web Store ZIP from the repo root:

```bash
pnpm --filter clips-chrome-extension package
```

Upload the generated artifact (the version matches `public/manifest.json`; the
Chrome Web Store requires each upload to use a higher version than the last):

```txt
templates/clips/chrome-extension/releases/clips-chrome-extension-<manifest-version>.zip
```

## Automated release

Use the **Publish Clips Chrome extension** workflow in GitHub Actions and run
it from `main`. It runs the extension tests, typecheck, build, version guard,
package upload, and Store publication submission. Anyone with permission to
run repository workflows can start it; Chrome Web Store access is held by the
short-lived GitHub OIDC identity.

The repository must have these variables configured once:

- `CLIPS_CWS_ITEM_ID`
- `CLIPS_CWS_PUBLISHER_ID`
- `CLIPS_CWS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`
- `CLIPS_CWS_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER`

Before the first run, add
`clips-cws-publisher@builder-3b0a2.iam.gserviceaccount.com` to the Chrome Web
Store Developer Dashboard under **Account** so the workflow can manage this
listing. This is a one-time publisher-account grant, not a GitHub secret.

Keep `public/manifest.json` at a version higher than the currently published
version before running the workflow. Google review can still leave the Store
submission in `PENDING_REVIEW` after the workflow succeeds.

## Web App Rollout Gate

The Web Store listing is live, and the web app shows the Chrome extension
option by default on hosts supported by the published manifest
(`clips.agent-native.com`, `localhost`, and `127.0.0.1`). Other deployments hide
the option unless they explicitly opt in with a matching extension/listing.

- `VITE_CLIPS_CHROME_EXTENSION_ENABLED=1` shows the Chrome option on custom
  deployments that have a compatible extension.
- `VITE_CLIPS_CHROME_EXTENSION_ENABLED=0` (or `false`/`no`/`off`) hides the
  Chrome option even on supported first-party/local hosts.
- `VITE_CLIPS_CHROME_EXTENSION_URL` overrides the default install URL
  (`https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/baoipacpchggcdigagnajakiidcgcffn`)
  if a deployment uses a different listing.
