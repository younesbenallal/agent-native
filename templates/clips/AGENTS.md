# Clips — Agent Guide

Clips is an agent-native screen recording, transcript, meetings, dictation, and
video sharing app. The agent and the UI share the same SQL data and actions.

## Skills

- `recording` — capture, upload, playback, Loom import, mobile, folders, bulk
  moves, Chrome extension.
- `ai-video-tools` — transcription, cleanup, titles, summaries, chapters,
  `voiceContext`, AI setup, Builder credits.
- `video-editing` — `editsJson`, trim/split/cut/speed/blur, export.
- `video-sharing` — visibility, passwords, expiry, embeds, Slack unfurls,
  agent-readable clips, discovery, view counts.
- `meetings`, `dictate` — calendar meetings, live notes, dictation.
- `brain-export` — `export-to-brain` exports, cursors, sweeps.
- `crm-call-evidence` — `prepare-crm-call-evidence` and CRM recipes.
- `screen-memory` — local-only desktop screen/app context.
- `bug-reports` — embedded `/bug-report` launcher and intake limits.
- `external-integrations` — Slack install, Atlassian/Jira, provider-API limits.

## Core Rules

- UI feedback: target 100 ms, never exceed 400 ms; acknowledge before network work.
- Keep large payloads out of SQL: no video/audio, images, PDFs, thumbnails,
  base64, or `data:` URLs in app tables, `application_state`, `settings`, or
  `resources` — persist URLs, ids, or handles and keep bytes in configured
  file/blob storage. Hosted uploads require storage; never fall back to SQL
  video bytes (dev scratch chunks excepted).
- Never hardcode API keys, tokens, webhook URLs, signing secrets, private
  Builder/internal data, customer data, or credential-looking literals. Use
  secrets/OAuth/runtime config and obvious placeholders.
- For external integrations, inspect the workspace/provider connection catalog first; reuse its scoped resolver.
- Use actions for recording metadata, transcripts, cleanup, summaries, chapters,
  comments, spaces/folders, meetings, and sharing. Never bypass access helpers.
- Comment text accepts inline Markdown for emphasis, inline code, links, and
  line breaks; headings and other block structures stay flattened in comments.
- Recording start/stop/pause are UI gestures — browser capture needs user
  activation; navigate to the recording view instead of a server action.
- Native transcript first; cloud transcription is fallback-only. Never hide a
  usable native transcript behind failed metadata work.
- Use `import-loom-recording` for Loom or direct MP4/WebM URLs. Loom media and
  public transcripts import in the background; direct videos need
  `request-transcript` afterward.
- Transactional email claims two-Clip summary work and ends with one sentence.
- The `view-screen` transcript is a bounded preview: when `previewTruncated` is
  true it may end mid-sentence with no signal of where transcription ended.
  Call `get-recording-player-data` before judging completeness or quoting.
- Public clips are unlisted-by-link, not a searchable catalog. Only inspect
  recordings the user owns, viewed, or shared a URL/id for. Never use
  `list-recordings`/`search-recordings` to find someone else's clip, answer a
  date question in context, or recover from a failed lookup — report the
  failure.
- Use framework sharing actions; password/expiry only tighten visibility and
  share grants.
- Screen Memory is local-only, disabled by default, and never a hosted or
  shareable Clips recording.
- Use `view-screen` when the active recording, transcript segment, meeting, or
  share context is unclear.
- Never fabricate; read via actions, verify writes by read-back; refresh after writes.

## Application State

- `navigation` — library, shared-with-me, recording, share, meeting, dictation,
  settings, and transcript context. A recording includes its focused `panel`
  and requested `atMs`; `navigate` can open that exact viewer context.
- `selection` — selected library recording ids while in selection mode.
- `recording-setup.import` — Loom import UI state while `/record` is open, never
  the pasted URL.
- `record-intent` — an agent-requested capture the recorder UI picks up, then
  clears.
