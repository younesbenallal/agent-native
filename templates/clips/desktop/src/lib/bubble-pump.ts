/**
 * JPEG frame pump for the camera bubble overlay.
 *
 * Owned by the popover (see `recorder.ts` top-of-file comment for the
 * WebKit capture-exclusion rationale — the popover is the only page that
 * can hold the camera, so it's also the page that emits frames to the
 * bubble overlay window). The pump reads from a given `MediaStream`, draws
 * each frame into an offscreen canvas, encodes JPEG, and emits
 * `clips:bubble-frame` events over Tauri IPC.
 *
 * The pump runs for the FULL camera session — pre-record preview AND
 * recording. The recorder does NOT start its own pump; it only consumes
 * the video track via MediaRecorder. That way a single pump instance
 * survives the preview → recording transition without any frame-drop
 * handoff, which was the source of the "bubble goes black when recording
 * starts" bug.
 *
 * Returns a stop fn that cancels the scheduler and releases the hidden
 * video + canvas elements. The caller owns the MediaStream lifecycle.
 *
 * ## Performance notes (updates-121)
 *
 * Previous versions ran at 10 FPS / 144px during recording and STILL
 * dropped frames to single-digits because the popover's main thread is
 * saturated during recording: MediaRecorder encoding video + audio +
 * continuous chunk `fetch()` uploads to localhost + Tauri IPC emit +
 * canvas.drawImage + canvas.toDataURL + getDisplayMedia + getUserMedia
 * stream internals. The pump competes with all of that for the one JS
 * main thread the webview has.
 *
 * Web research findings (April 2026, WKWebView on macOS):
 * - OffscreenCanvas + transferControlToOffscreen in a Worker is only
 *   reliable for WebGL contexts on Safari 17+; the 2D context path in
 *   a Worker has been historically unreliable in WebKit (three.js issue
 *   16782, Safari Tech Preview thread 704724). Risky for production.
 * - MediaStreamTrackProcessor is Tech Preview in Safari 18+, and only
 *   fully shipped in Safari 26+. Can't rely on it.
 * - createImageBitmap from a <video> element is documented-slow on
 *   Safari (WebKit bug 234920 — "ImageBitmap created from a video
 *   element has poor performance"). Avoid.
 * - HTMLImageElement.decode() is well-supported on Safari since ~15
 *   and decodes off the main thread. This is the fast receive path.
 *
 * So we picked the defensible combination:
 *
 * 1. **Recording relay kept readable** — full-screen capture now uses the
 *    bubble's local camera path, but window capture can still need this
 *    fallback. Keep recording frames at retina-small-bubble resolution so the
 *    user's face does not turn blocky.
 * 2. **Chunk-upload yielding** (new) — the recorder sets
 *    `window.clipsChunkBusy = true` while a chunk upload is in flight;
 *    the pump skips ticks while that flag is set. With MediaRecorder
 *    configured for ~1s chunks, this means the pump gets a clear
 *    ~150-300ms slice of main thread each second where it CAN'T
 *    possibly be competing with the chunk POST.
 * 3. **Async image decode with yielding** (Option C adapted) — we
 *    still use canvas.drawImage + canvas.toDataURL (the WebKit-fast
 *    path — no blob round-trip, no bitmap creation from a video), but
 *    we trigger the encode inside a `queueMicrotask` so the rVFC
 *    callback returns quickly, letting the compositor render a frame
 *    before we synchronously block the thread on toDataURL.
 * 4. **Frame-time budget guard** — if the PREVIOUS encode took longer
 *    than the per-frame budget, skip the next tick outright. Prevents
 *    the pump from falling into a "I'm always running" mode when the
 *    main thread is overloaded; instead it gracefully drops to
 *    whatever framerate the system can actually sustain.
 * 5. **Receiver image pool** (Option D) — see `bubble.tsx`. We swap
 *    between two `<img>` elements so the previous decode can complete
 *    without being cancelled by the incoming frame, preserving the
 *    useful work the decode pipeline did.
 *
 * Fallbacks: all new signals (`window.clipsChunkBusy`, rVFC,
 * OffscreenCanvas) feature-detect and degrade to the previous path if
 * absent. The pump MUST keep producing frames even if every optimistic
 * path fails; the user should never see a black bubble.
