# Design editor — real-browser E2E

End-to-end tests that drive the **visual editor** in real Chromium with
`@playwright/test`. They exercise the things unit tests can't: selecting,
resizing, moving/reparenting, the layers panel, and the iframe bridge.

## Run

```bash
pnpm e2e          # headless
pnpm e2e:headed   # watch it drive a real browser
pnpm e2e:ui       # Playwright UI mode
E2E_BROWSER_CHANNEL=chrome pnpm e2e  # run the suite in installed Google Chrome
```

- `playwright.config.ts` starts its own dev server on **:9333** backed by a
  throwaway PGlite database (`data/pglite/e2e`) — `APP_NAME=design` +
  `DESIGN_DATABASE_URL=pglite:...` so a `.env` database URL can never leak in.
- Locally, if a server is already running on :9333 it is **reused**
  (`reuseExistingServer`). The most reliable local loop is to keep a server up
  yourself and run against it:
  ```bash
  APP_NAME=design DESIGN_DATABASE_URL="pglite:./data/pglite/e2e" PORT=9333 pnpm dev   # one terminal
  E2E_BASE_URL=http://localhost:9333 pnpm e2e                                   # another
  ```
  `E2E_BASE_URL` makes Playwright skip server management entirely and just use
  yours — handy when the cold Vite optimize is slow under Playwright's spawn.

`e2e/global-setup.ts` signs up a test user (email/password — there is **no dev
auth bypass**), saves the signed session to `e2e/.auth/state.json`, and seeds
one design with a known fixture (`e2e/.auth/seed.json`) via the authenticated
action endpoints. Both `.auth/` files are gitignored.

## Why the editor needs special handling (the hard-won bits)

The design renders inside a sandboxed iframe, and a pointer-capturing shield
overlay sits on top. So:

| Symptom                                                                 | Wrong approach                         | Right approach                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reaching into iframe DOM                                                | parent-document locators               | `page.frameLocator('iframe').locator(...)` — Playwright targets the frame directly and stays stable across sandbox/overlay changes                                                                                          |
| Clicks "intercepted by `<div data-agent-native-edit-overlay="shield">`" | normal click (actionability fails)     | `.click({ force: true })` — the shield is _meant_ to get the event and drive selection                                                                                                                                      |
| Asserting an edit happened                                              | reading iframe state                   | listen for the bridge's parent `postMessage`s: `element-select`, `element-hover`, `visual-style-change`, `visual-structure-change` (see `installBridge`/`waitForBridge`)                                                    |
| `page.screenshot()` hangs forever                                       | `page.screenshot()`                    | `cdpScreenshot()` — CDP `Page.captureScreenshot`, no stability wait (the page never idles; the agent-chat panel polls)                                                                                                      |
| Node ids change between runs                                            | hardcoding `data-agent-native-node-id` | select by **text/role**, then read the stamped id back from the `element-select` payload                                                                                                                                    |
| Drag move/resize                                                        | HTML5 `dragTo` on the canvas           | `page.mouse.move/down/up` with intermediate steps at `boundingBox()` coords (the canvas uses raw pointer events). The **layers panel** is in the parent doc and _does_ use HTML5 DnD → `locator.dragTo()`.                  |
| Inspector never renders — the right panel is empty                      | waiting longer for the panel           | `design-selection` state is per USER, so a reused db can restore **responsive-preview** mode into a brand-new design and unmount the inspector. Click `Exit responsive preview` before _and_ after `enterDirectMode`.       |
| Selecting a nested layer lands on the screen instead                    | one canvas click on the child          | Figma drill-in: the first click selects the screen root. Click the **Layers tree** row (expanding ancestors first) and assert `[role="treeitem"][aria-selected="true"]` — a canvas click gives a different selection shape. |
| An editor command silently does nothing                                 | guessing from the source               | Every command traces its refusal. `page.evaluate(() => window.__designTrace.dump())` after the click prints `structure:align-abandoned` with the reason; `__designTrace.clear()` first to scope it.                         |

`helpers.ts` wraps all of this: `gotoEditor`, `selectByText`, `dragCanvasByText`,
`installBridge`/`waitForBridge`, `cdpScreenshot`, `readSeedDesignId`.

## Live multi-screen runtime proof

With the Design app, Slides app, and localhost bridge running, this committed
Playwright harness opens 30 real URL-backed screens, records the boot drain and
bridge failures, and writes screenshots under `.tmp/visual-edit-proof`:

```bash
corepack pnpm --dir templates/design exec tsx scripts/visual-edit-runtime-proof.ts
```

Set `VISUAL_EDIT_EDITOR_URL` to inspect an existing design instead of creating
and deleting a temporary one. Authenticated sign-in/sign-out propagation remains
a separate local proof that uses a throwaway auth-enabled Slides database and a
fresh bridge process, never a real account's credentials:

```bash
VISUAL_EDIT_AUTH_SLIDES_URL=http://localhost:8086 \
VISUAL_EDIT_AUTH_BRIDGE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7334 \
VISUAL_EDIT_AUTH_BRIDGE_TOKEN=visual-edit-auth-proof-token-fresh \
corepack pnpm --dir templates/design exec tsx scripts/visual-edit-auth-runtime-proof.ts
```

The auth harness opens `/sign-in`, `/home`, and `/settings`, verifies the
signed-out and signed-in frame sets, performs an authenticated structure drag
and `get-visual-edit-prompt` call, signs out from a settings frame, and checks
that all three frames return to signed-out state. It writes the artifact and
screenshots to `.tmp/visual-edit-proof/`.

## Driving your REAL, logged-in Chrome (chrome-devtools-mcp)

Playwright (above) is best for deterministic CI against a local throwaway DB.
To exercise the **deployed app with your actual Google session** — no test
user, no seeding — drive a real Chrome over CDP:

```bash
# 1. Launch Chrome (144+) with remote debugging. Use a separate profile dir so
#    you can sign in normally without touching your main profile.
"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" \
  --remote-debugging-port=9222 \
  --user-data-dir="$HOME/.chrome-e2e" &
# 2. Sign in to the deployed Design app in that window.
```

Then attach the agent's **`chrome-devtools-mcp`** built-in (the `/qa` skill
toggles it; it runs `npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest --autoConnect`) and drive it
with `navigate_page` / `take_snapshot` / `evaluate_script` / `click`. The exact
same editor techniques apply — `evaluate_script` can install the bridge listener
and read frame content; clicks go through the shield. This path uses your live
auth and data, so it's ideal for manual/exploratory verification and smoke-
testing prod, while the Playwright suite stays the deterministic regression net.
