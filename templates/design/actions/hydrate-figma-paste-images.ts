/**
 * Retroactively resolve unresolved Figma image fills for a screen that was
 * imported via the local-kiwi clipboard path, using Figma's REST image
 * endpoint (requires a saved FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN).
 *
 * When a Figma paste is imported without an access token, IMAGE fills render as
 * `url("about:blank")` placeholders. The originating elements are annotated
 * with `data-figma-image-ref="hash1 hash2 …"` so this action can find them
 * without a full re-parse. Each Nth hash in the attribute maps to the Nth
 * `url(&quot;about:blank&quot;)` occurrence in the element's style attribute.
 *
 * The read → collect → resolve → persist pipeline lives in
 * `server/lib/figma-image-hydration.ts` and is shared with the token-free
 * `.fig` hydration path (see `hydrateFileImagesFromFig`). This action only
 * supplies the REST resolver.
