/**
 * list-design-extensions — read action.
 *
 * Returns the first-party Design Studio extensions with their capability and
 * availability status.  The four built-in extensions are:
 *
 *   1. Asset Library     — selection-aware asset insertion (ships now).
 *   2. Shader Fills      — GPU shader fill previews (preview-only now; apply gated).
 *   3. Token Auditor     — reads token usage across the design and flags clashes.
 *   4. Motion Presets    — one-click motion preset application.
 *
 * These are FIRST-PARTY extensions described as static metadata — they do not
 * live in the extensions SQL table (they are capabilities of the design app,
 * not user-created Alpine mini-apps).  The UI surfaces them in the
 * `design.editor.inspector` slot alongside user-installed extensions.
 *
 * The action also returns which actions power each extension, so the agent
 * can invoke them directly without going through the extension iframe sandbox.
 *
 * Plan reference: DESIGN-STUDIO-PLAN.md §6.7 + §7 (`list-design-extensions`).
