/**
 * migrate-inline-design-to-app — generate a real React + Tailwind app branch
 * from an inline Alpine/HTML design via the Builder cloud agent.
 *
 * ## What this action does
 *
 * 1. Requires viewer access to the design and that Builder is fully configured
 *    (credentials + branch project ID).  When Builder is not configured it
 *    returns a connect CTA gracefully, never throws.
 * 2. Reads the current design snapshot (live Yjs content when available).
 * 3. Snapshots the current state into `design_versions` (reversible baseline).
 * 4. Builds a migration seed (HTML + :root CSS vars + Brand Kit tokens) via
 *    `buildMigrationSeed` and hands it to `runBuilderAgent`.
 * 5. Returns `{ branchName, url, status, versionId }` so the caller can track
 *    the Builder branch and roll back via `versionId` if needed.
 *
 * ## Write gating (per DESIGN-STUDIO-PLAN.md §3 & §5)
 *
 * - `writeFile` / `writeTokens` / `writeMotion` on the inline source stay
 *   **planned** until bridge hardening.  This action does NOT write to the
 *   inline design's source files.
 * - `branch` / `deploy` capabilities are **available** once Builder is
 *   configured (fusion source tier).  This action is the entry point for that
 *   tier — it creates the Builder branch, NOT a local file write.
 * - The `design_versions` snapshot is the only local write: it is additive and
 *   never modifies the existing design data.
 *
 * ## Reversibility
 *
 * The snapshot saved as `design_versions` before the migration gives the user
 * a named restore point ("Pre-migration snapshot").  A future `restore-design-
 * version` action can replay it.  The original inline design row is unchanged.
 *
 * ## Connect CTA path
 *
 * When Builder is not connected this action returns:
 * ```json
 * { "status": "not-configured", "cta": { "kind": "connect-builder", ... } }
 * ```
 * so the UI can render the "Make it real" upgrade card without throwing.
 * The caller should offer `connect-builder-app` to surface the CTA first.
