/**
 * Sample bridge — proves the compile-time pipeline.
 *
 * Rules that every *.bridge.ts MUST follow:
 *   • No import/require of any module (DOM globals only).
 *   • No references to outer/module scope (the code runs inside an iframe).
 *   • Wrap everything in a self-executing IIFE.
 *   • Type-only imports (erased by tsc) are permitted if needed for doc purposes,
 *     but in practice they are unnecessary since no app types are reachable here.
