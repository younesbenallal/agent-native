/**
 * PF12: gesture-lifecycle metadata threaded alongside a style commit.
 *
 * - "preview": a live, in-progress tick (a ScrubInput scrub sample or a
 *   DesignColorPicker drag tick) — cheap to show in the live iframe preview,
 *   but must NOT trigger the expensive source commit (projection parse + HTML
 *   patch + history entry) on every tick.
 * - "commit" (or omitted, for callers that don't pass meta at all): the
 *   gesture's authoritative final value — exactly one per gesture — which
 *   DOES trigger the full source commit. Omitting meta entirely preserves
 *   prior behavior (treated as "commit") for every non-scrub/color call site.
 * - "cancel": the preview was restored to its pointerdown value and its
 *   uncommitted history lineage should be discarded without another write.
 *
 * - `interactionState`: set on EVERY style commit (regardless of `phase`)
 *   while the inspector's element interaction-state selector
 *   (`InteractionStatePanel`) has a non-default state active — see
 *   `shared/interaction-states.ts` for the persisted format. Omitted (or
 *   `undefined`) means "commit to the element's normal inline style /
 *   class", exactly like today. This is a PHASE-2 CONTRACT: EditPanel only
 *   attaches the field, it never calls the shared upsert helpers itself —
 *   DesignEditor's `onStyleChange`/`onStylesChange` handlers must branch on
 *   `meta.interactionState` and, when present, route the commit through
 *   `upsertStateStyle` / `upsertStateStyles` (targeting `activeContent` +
 *   the selected element's `sourceId` as the node id) instead of the normal
 *   inline-style patch path, then re-derive the forced-preview twins with
 *   `duplicateStatePreviewRules` before persisting — all as ONE history
 *   step, same as any other single style commit today.
 *
 * - `breakpointReset`: set ONLY on the synthetic commit fired by a
 *   `BreakpointOverrideIndicator`'s reset button (see `breakpointContext` on
 *   `EditPanelProps`). Means "clear this property's override at
 *   `maxWidthPx`, don't write a new value" — the accompanying `value`
 *   argument on `onStyleChange`/`onStylesChange` is the CURRENT (base or
 *   wider-scope) value the field falls back to displaying, not a value to
 *   persist. CONTRACT: DesignEditor's handlers must branch on
 *   `meta.breakpointReset` and, when present, call
 *   `removeBreakpointMediaDeclaration` (or clear the matching max-width
 *   utility class — whichever persistence layer
 *   `getBreakpointOverrideState` reported the override on) for `property` at
 *   `maxWidthPx`, instead of writing `value` through the normal inline-style
 *   /  managed-breakpoint-block commit path.
