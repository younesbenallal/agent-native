/**
 * TIE-BREAK: decides whether polled DB content should be adopted into the
 * live editor during the file-content reconcile effect (DesignEditor.tsx).
 * Callers only reach this decision once BOTH of the effect's own
 * "already reflecting this exact content" early-returns have already ruled
 * out `dbContent` matching what's currently rendered — so every call here
 * represents a genuine content difference.
 *
 * A strict `dbUpdatedAt > applied` used to be the only "is this newer"
 * check, which silently DROPPED a real external write whenever it landed in
 * the same millisecond as the previously-applied one (timestamp
 * resolution) — the tie was never treated as "newer," so the second write's
 * content just never rendered. That's only safe to fix by treating a tie as
 * adoptable while `agentActive` is false: when the agent IS active, a tied
 * timestamp with different content is more likely a live self-echo race
 * (the agent's own Yjs-tracked edit still mid-flight), which the caller's
 * `staleAgentEchoPossible` debounced recovery timer already handles
 * separately and more carefully — forcing immediate adoption for that case
 * too would skip the debounce and reintroduce the exact race it exists to
 * prevent.
