# {{APP_NAME}} — Development Guide

This guide is for development-mode agents editing this app's source code. For app operations and tools, see AGENTS.md.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** @agent-native/core + React Router v8 (framework mode)
- **Frontend:** React 19, Vite, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui
- **Routing:** File-based via `flatRoutes()` — SSR shell + client rendering
- **Backend:** Nitro (via @agent-native/core) — file-based API routing, server plugins, deploy-anywhere presets
- **State:** SQL-backed (SSE for real-time updates)

## Commands

- **Dev:** `pnpm dev` (Vite dev server with both React Router + Nitro plugins)
- **Build:** `pnpm build` (React Router build — client + SSR + Nitro server)
- **Start:** `node .output/server/index.mjs` (production)
- **Design local bridge:** `npx @agent-native/core@latest design connect --url http://localhost:5173 --root .`
  exposes a local manifest for Design's localhost source mode and scaffolds
  `.agent-native/design-routes.json` without overwriting an existing file.
- **Visual edit local apps:** `/visual-edit` registers that bridge with
  `connect-localhost`, adds URL-backed iframe screens with
  `add-localhost-screens`, and opens the editor in overview mode.

## Framework Basics

**SSR-first framework, CSR-by-default content:** This app uses React Router v8 framework mode with `ssr: true`. But virtually every route renders only an SSR shell (loading spinner + meta tags). Normal app data fetching happens on the client via action hooks. Server-side data fetching is the exception — only used for public pages that need SEO/OG tags.

## Adding a Page

Create a file in `app/routes/`. The filename determines the URL path:

```
app/routes/_index.tsx              → /
app/routes/settings.tsx            → /settings
app/routes/inbox.tsx               → /inbox
app/routes/inbox.$threadId.tsx     → /inbox/:threadId
app/routes/$id.tsx                 → /:id (dynamic param)
```

Each route file exports a default component, optional `meta()`, and optional `HydrateFallback()`:

```tsx
import MyPage from "@/pages/MyPage";

export function meta() {
  return [{ title: "My Page" }];
}

export function HydrateFallback() {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center h-screen">
      <div className="animate-spin rounded-full h-8 w-8 border-b-2 border-foreground" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default function MyPageRoute() {
  return <MyPage />;
}
```

**Do NOT fetch data server-side** in route loaders unless the page genuinely needs SEO/OG content. The standard pattern is: SSR renders the shell, client hydrates, and React reads/writes normal app data through actions with `useActionQuery` / `useActionMutation`.

## Adding App Data

Normal app data starts as an action, not a custom route. Add `actions/<verb>-<resource>.ts` with `defineAction`, mark reads with `http: { method: "GET" }`, and call reads/writes from React with `useActionQuery` / `useActionMutation` from `@agent-native/core/client`. This keeps the UI and agent on one contract and lets mutating actions refresh action-backed queries automatically.

## Design Source Modes

The shared source model lives in `shared/source-mode.ts`. Use `inline` for
SQL-backed prototype files, `localhost` for local dev-server artboards, and
`fusion` only for future hybrid/hosted sources. Bridge operations are named
`select`, `resolveNodeToFile`, `readFile`, `applyEdit`, `writeFile`,
`captureSnapshot`, and `captureState`. Localhost file writes run through the
token-authenticated bridge and require an explicit, time-boxed human consent
grant. Deterministic JSX write-back is intentionally limited to exact
single-instance leaf text and literal class/style edits; ambiguous or semantic
changes fail closed for coding-agent inspection.

## Editor Model

Design has two editor views:

- **Overview** is the default multi-screen canvas after generation or broad
  updates. It renders every screen as a static, movable frame on an infinite
  surface. Users can select screens, move/resize/drop frames and primitives,
  edit layers in place, and use a frame's Interact button to focus it.
- **Single screen** renders one file in the iframe editor. Use it for scrolling,
  interacting with prototype behavior, text/DOM selection, and local visual
  edits inside that screen.

The layers panel treats screens/files as top-level frames and nests projected
DOM/code layers under the active screen. Layer display names come from
`data-agent-native-layer-name` first, then semantic/text fallbacks. Persist user
renames by editing that attribute in the source; ids such as
`data-code-layer-id` are for stable selection targets.
Inline/Alpine HTML should also carry durable `data-agent-native-node-id`
attributes for any layer the editor can select, reorder, duplicate, or patch.
Selectors are fallback aliases, not the primary identity. Localhost React mode
should resolve through build-time source/debug metadata (generated stable id,
component, file, and line) before using selector fallbacks.

Inline source mode supports code-layer projection and deterministic HTML edits
through `get-code-layer-projection` and `apply-visual-edit`. Localhost JSX/TSX
supports diff-first literal leaf text/class/style edits when an exact source
anchor resolves to one current file; structural, dynamic, repeated, shared, and
breakpoint edits remain semantic coding-agent work.

## Adding a Route-Only Endpoint

Use `server/routes/api/` only for protocols that cannot be modeled as JSON actions: multipart uploads, streaming/SSE/WebSocket, webhooks, OAuth callbacks/redirects, public SEO/OG endpoints, or binary/static asset serving. Do not add `/api/*` routes for normal CRUD, data queries, or pass-through wrappers around actions; the action endpoint already exists at `/_agent-native/actions/:name`.

Each route-only endpoint still exports a default `defineEventHandler`, but keep shared app logic in actions or server libraries so agent and UI behavior do not fork.

## Adding a Server Plugin

Startup logic (auth, SSE, etc.) lives in `server/plugins/`. Use `defineNitroPlugin` from core:

```ts
import { defineNitroPlugin } from "@agent-native/core";

export default defineNitroPlugin(async (nitroApp) => {
  // Runs once at server startup
});
```

## Key Imports from `@agent-native/core`

| Import                                       | Purpose                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `defineNitroPlugin`                          | Define a server plugin (re-exported from Nitro)                            |
| `createDefaultSSEHandler`                    | Create SSE endpoint for DB change events (server)                          |
| `readAppState`, `writeAppState`              | Read/write application state (from `@agent-native/core/application-state`) |
| `readSetting`, `writeSetting`                | Read/write settings (from `@agent-native/core/settings`)                   |
| `defineEventHandler`, `readBody`, `getQuery` | H3 route handler utilities (re-exported)                                   |
| `sendToAgentChat`                            | Send messages to agent from UI (client-side)                               |
| `agentChat`                                  | Send messages to agent from scripts (server-side)                          |

## Adding an Action

Create `actions/<verb>-<resource>.ts` with `defineAction`. Run with `pnpm action <name> --id value`; React callers should use `useActionQuery` for GET actions and `useActionMutation` for mutating actions, not a matching `/api/*` wrapper.

**Sending to agent chat from UI:**

```ts
import { sendToAgentChat } from "@agent-native/core/client";
sendToAgentChat({
  message: "Generate something",
  context: "...",
  submit: true,
});
```

**Sending to agent chat from scripts:**

```ts
import { agentChat } from "@agent-native/core";
agentChat.submit("Generate something");
```

## Database & Environment Variables

Local development uses PGlite at `data/pglite`. For production and shared environments, set `DATABASE_URL` to a persistent hosted PostgreSQL database.

Real credential values belong only in local `.env` files, deployment configuration, or registered secrets/settings UI. Never commit, document, log, return, paste, or include real keys, tokens, webhook URLs, signing secrets, or private data in examples; use empty values or obvious placeholders.

| Variable       | Required                     | Description                                                                   |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Production yes, local dev no | PostgreSQL or PGlite database URL (local dev default: `pglite:./data/pglite`) |

## Extensions (Framework Feature)

The framework provides **Extensions** — mini sandboxed Alpine.js apps that run inside iframes. Extensions let users (or the agent) create interactive widgets, dashboards, and utilities without modifying the app's source code. They appear in the sidebar under an "Extensions" section. (Distinct from LLM tools — the function-calling primitives the agent invokes.)

- **Creating extensions**: Via the sidebar "+" button, agent chat, or `POST /_agent-native/extensions`
- **API calls**: Extensions use `extensionFetch()` (legacy alias `toolFetch`) which proxies requests through the server with `${keys.NAME}` secret injection
- **Styling**: Extensions inherit the main app's Tailwind v4 theme automatically
- **Sharing**: Private by default, shareable with org or specific users (same model as other ownable resources)
- **Security**: Iframe sandbox + CSP + SSRF protection on the proxy

See the `extensions` skill in `.agents/skills/extensions/SKILL.md` for full implementation details.
