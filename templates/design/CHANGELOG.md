- Design loads translated catalogs and AI prompt tools only when you need them.

### Fixed

- Entering Interact on a frame with unsaved live edits is now blocked consistently, matching the toolbar Interact toggle

## 2026-09-15

### Added

- Added draggable corner-radius handles to the selection outline (drag inward to round corners, like Figma) and polished the outer resize handle styling

### Improved

- Auto layout controls use a compact alignment and gap layout with smaller constraint controls.
- Keep the Screens list focused and resize its split with Layers
- Large-design element selection keeps bulk geometry collection lightweight for faster marquee interactions.
- Large visual-edit maps limit concurrent live app boots so more screens stay responsive
- Layers have more breathing room, smaller chevrons, and balanced toolbar icons; inspector tabs have more vertical padding.
- Main component structure edits stay linked across instances, and deleted main components can be restored from an instance.
- Marquee select and double-click element select on the canvas are much faster on large screens.
- Responsive breakpoint edits preserve authored CSS, and Shift-dragging a padding handle updates all four sides together.
- Account menus are now shorter, with workspace apps and agent management available in Settings.
- Visual structure reorders now verify after source updates even when HMR changes runtime identities

### Fixed

- Fixed .fig file import placing multi-frame flows in reverse order — frames now import in left-to-right canvas order instead of layer/creation order
- Fixed fill dialog tooltips (paint type tabs, eyedropper, document colors) rendering behind the dialog instead of in front of it
- Fixed the live width × height readout shown while drawing a new shape to render as a rounded blue pill, matching the equivalent resize readout
- Fixed polygon and star shapes getting letterboxed instead of resizing with their bounding box
- Fixed the width × height label shown while resizing an element rendering as plain unstyled text instead of a visible colored badge
- Alt-dragging a layer inside a group now keeps the duplicate under the cursor for the whole drag instead of jumping into place on release.
- Breakpoint width edits preserve the existing breakpoint, and new Screens stay clear of visible breakpoint previews.
- Changing a grid's column or row count no longer turns fill or hug tracks into fixed pixel sizes
- Creating and focusing Screens keeps the canvas zoom and position stable.
- Figma imports preserve original layer names in the Layers panel
- Figma layer names now survive import, rename, and reload in Design
- Fixed padding indicator tick marks so they render at the same length on every edge
- Groups now resize with linked text overrides in the editor, previews, and exports.
- Keep local Design rotation edits undoable while preserving collaboration conflict checks.
- New designs start with fresh prompts, reliable asset picking, and responsive screens.
- Overview canvas no longer shows generated screens as blank or black frames at low zoom
- Prevent pending visual edits from being lost during screen navigation
- Rapid dependent layout edits now retain changes made immediately before them.
- Restore the standard Agent-Native chat header and tabs in the Design editor.
- Text typed immediately after clicking the Text tool on empty canvas space is no longer lost, and the new layer is named from what you typed
- The Letter spacing field now accepts percentages and em values like Figma, and keeps two decimals instead of rounding 0.64 to 0.6
- Visual edit maps keep query-specific screens distinct and expose the latest native WebMCP surface.

## 2026-09-14

### Added

- Component duplicates stay linked to their main across Screens, and detaching keeps their current appearance

### Fixed

- Rapid layout and padding edits preserve previously committed styles.
- Screen creation preserves drawn dimensions and layer identity for immediate visual edits.
- Selecting an element in a live React app now anchors to the authored component file and owner instead of the JSX runtime, so source edits and repeated-instance counts target the real code
- Undo and redo follow the order of edits across screens.
- Zoom to selection includes selected layers across Screens and the board, and multiline text stays a single Text layer.

### Changed

- Creative Context is now in Labs and off by default

## 2026-09-13

### Improved

- Screen layout, style edits, keyboard shortcuts, and edits to AI-generated designs work more reliably through undo and reload

### Fixed

- Undo works immediately after editing a size field in the inspector

### Security

- Public Design links no longer expose captured state data

## 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- A generated design now gets a prompt-based title when no title comes back.
- Canvas panning stays proportional at every zoom level.
- Closed shapes and pen paths support inside, center, and outside stroke alignment.
- Custom breakpoints can be added after Tablet, and Enter applies their width.
- Deselecting a text layer clears the leftover text highlight.
- Design generation no longer stays stuck when an agent run ends without its final chat update.
- Edit with AI shows the selected layer name and uses the current theme for its hover highlight.
- Gradient fills stay gradients when you edit them.
- Grouped layers are easier to edit: click selects the group, double-click opens a child, and paste preserves group placement.
- Interact mode keeps its toolbar and height controls within the available canvas.
- The inspector's export Preview now renders a thumbnail when a whole screen or
  frame is selected, instead of always reporting "Preview unavailable" next to a
  working Export button.
- The Questions panel no longer overlaps the navigation rail.

## 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- Moving the pointer over the canvas no longer takes focus away from a composer
  or comment box that just opened, so you can type into it straight away.
- Screens no longer creep taller each time a selection handle reaches the bottom
  edge of a frame — the editor's own overlays are no longer measured as page
  content.

## 2026-09-10

### Added

- Design editor version history: browse and restore saved checkpoints from the top-left menu or Cmd+K.

### Improved

- The Layers panel is denser with smaller text, icons, and row height.
- Opening or closing the left sidebar (or toggling minimal mode) no longer shifts designs on the canvas.
- Breakpoint add control keeps a clear gap from the screen edge and shows immediate feedback while adding.

### Fixed

- Clicking a button or other painted text element on the canvas selects that
  element, not the wrapper the editor puts around its text — so its corner
  radius, fill and component props are editable again.
- Exported SVGs no longer break on designs that use Alpine list or conditional blocks.
- PNG and PDF exports now render text with the design's own webfonts, so highlights, gradients and underlines stay aligned with the text.

### Changed

- Design canvas chrome now overlays instead of resizing the board, so opening or closing the left panel and minimal mode no longer shifts screens on the canvas.

### Removed

- Removed the always-visible design system picker above the design editor chat.

## 2026-09-09

### Improved

- Collaborator avatars in the design editor use a slimmer border.

## 2026-09-04

### Improved

- The designs list now fills every row instead of leaving a single card stranded on the last one, and the card actions menu is readable in light mode.
- The design system picker stays in the editor chat after a template fills the design, so later prompts can still target a specific system.

### Fixed

- Text drawn straight onto the canvas now takes a colour you can read against it, instead of always being white.
- Design editor links now keep agent tools available.
- Choosing "No design system" now clears the design's system instead of snapping back to your default.
- Drawing the first shape on the board no longer flips the canvas to a different colour, and the Canvas swatch shows the colour it is painted with instead of "NONE".

## 2026-09-02

### Fixed

- Fill and Stroke in the inspector now paint a pen path, line, polygon, or star itself rather than tinting its selection bounding box.
- A closed pen path now takes the same fill and no stroke a drawn rectangle takes, instead of a black outline you had to hide.
- Edit with AI now opens a focused editing prompt for selected elements in multi-screen view and reliably returns generated options without misclassifying an active request as superseded.
- A greeting or question as the first message in a new design no longer ends with a false "couldn't confirm that a Design artifact was saved" reply.

## 2026-09-01

### Fixed

- Frame labels now move smoothly into place after canvas zoom changes.
- The Share button stays inside the editor's right panel. At the panel's default width the action row was wider than the panel, so Share was clipped at the window edge; Add to Context now collapses to an icon with a tooltip when the panel is narrow, and the whole row fits.

## 2026-08-28

### Added

- Screens can carry a layout grid, like Figma's: set a size in the inspector and everything you drag, draw, or resize inside that screen lands on it. Ctrl+G (Ctrl+Shift+4 on Windows) shows or hides the lines, holding Cmd while dragging ignores the grid, and the agent reads the same grid so the layout it writes matches what you get by hand.

### Fixed

- X and Y are always whole numbers now. Drawing or dropping something while zoomed out used to commit a position like 192.1px, and the inspector showed the fraction back to you; every placement, drag, resize, and constraint change now lands on a whole pixel. The big nudge (Shift plus an arrow key) moved from 10px to 8px so it steps along the same grid, and board frames finally respect the nudge amounts you configure.

## 2026-08-27

### Added

- Outermost frames now show their name above them on the canvas, and clicking the name selects the frame.

### Improved

- Grid auto layout now lays a frame's children out in its cells and draws the cell grid on canvas, with a Figma-style track picker and separate column and row gap fields.
- Pasting a frame from Figma now matches what importing the same frame over the API produces — union shapes like speech bubbles keep their outline, and masked artwork is clipped to the right shape.
- Figma import now matches Figma's own layout node for node on 23 of 26 real community designs, and a page's large images survive the export back to Figma instead of being dropped.

### Fixed

- Answered design questions now continue in the existing design instead of creating a duplicate.

## 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- A toast now appears when a screen save conflicts with an edit made elsewhere.
- Creating a new design no longer treats the empty board file as finished generation.
- Dropping a layer onto an empty screen now places it at the pointer instead of the top-left corner.
- Opening the same design in two tabs no longer undoes to the other tab's unsynced layout.
- Paste over a copied layer now lands next to the original instead of creating an invisible extra layer.
- Dragging a layer out of its screen now shows a proxy the size of that layer following your cursor, instead of a small dot that made the layer look like it had vanished. A release the canvas cannot place no longer drops the layer in the top-left corner, and a drag interrupted by switching windows restores the layer where it started.
- Design no longer asks users to confirm guided questions they have already answered.

## 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- Rubber-band selection now works when you start the drag on empty space inside a screen, instead of picking the whole screen up and moving it. The band also catches layers it used to skip: elements with no id of their own, hairline rules, and zero-height rows. Clicking a horizontal line selects the line itself with a grabbable outline rather than a two-pixel sliver, and clicking into a screen that is already selected now selects the element under your cursor on the first click.

## 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- Adding auto layout to a stack of full-width rows now picks vertical flow instead of laying them out side by side.
- Dragging an element inside a frame no longer fades it to a duller color or highlights the frame as a drop target, and it no longer moves the element to the front of its frame's stacking order. The element keeps its exact appearance and layering while it moves.
- Dropping an element into a frame that already has content now leaves that frame's layout alone instead of turning it into a horizontal row.

## 2026-08-22

### Fixed

- Generating or updating several screens in one request no longer loses an already-saved screen's layout and styling when another screen in the same request hits a save conflict — the saved screen keeps its placement, and the conflicting screen is reported so you can retry just that one.
- The rename design and search text fields on the Designs home page now have accessible names, so screen readers announce them instead of leaving them unlabeled.

## 2026-08-21

### Added

- Press I anywhere on the canvas to sample a color with the eyedropper and apply it to the selection.
- Scale now applies to a multi-selection: drag a corner of the group box and every selected object scales together.

### Improved

- Dragging a screen or an element now lights up every edge and centre it lines up with, snaps spacing to gaps that already exist, and shows its pixel size and constraint lines.
- Scale resizes the text inside an object along with its box and stroke, matching Figma.

### Fixed

- Completed Builder design-system imports now update the local Design system with indexed tokens, become the default when no default exists, and stay out of generation until ready.
- Completed Builder design-system imports now update the local Design system with indexed tokens instead of leaving placeholder values.
- Draw mode now needs Shift+Y, so a single stray keystroke can no longer switch the editor into annotate mode.
- Moving or scaling several objects at once keeps them all selected, so you can keep adjusting instead of falling back to one object.
- Inspector number fields keep focus after Enter, so the next keystroke edits the field instead of triggering a canvas shortcut.
- Pen: holding Alt on a new anchor now keeps the incoming handle where it was and stays broken after you release Alt.
- Finishing a pen path on the canvas board creates one vector instead of two, and leaves the Pen tool armed for the next path.
- Selecting another object keeps the Scale tool armed instead of dropping you back to Move.
- The shape tool now stays on the shape you picked — drawing an ellipse no longer resets the toolbar button to Rectangle.
- Pen paths, lines, arrows, polygons and stars drawn inside a frame now land where you drew them instead of jumping by the frame's position.

## 2026-08-20

### Improved

- Deleting or editing an element patches the canvas in place instead of rebuilding the frame, so scroll position, focus and running component state survive the edit.

## 2026-08-18

### Improved

- Design chat keeps context out of the composer and uses shorter completion summaries.

### Changed

- Advanced Design editor panels are hidden by default while they are refined.

## 2026-08-13

### Added

- The design audit now catches a screen that renders behind a full-frame Alpine overlay — the failure a screenshot cannot show, because the capture waits for Alpine to settle and the overlay is gone by then.
- The design audit now reports when a screen uses none of its linked design system's fonts, colors, or token names.

### Improved

- Attach a UI screenshot and the design is reproduced from it instead of being reinterpreted as three alternative directions.
- The design system preview now shows how many named tokens were captured, so a large imported system no longer looks like a handful of colors.

### Fixed

- A screen whose Alpine overlay would cover it on load — `x-cloak` without its hiding rule, or a broken Alpine script URL — is now caught when it is saved instead of shipping as a blank or covered design.
- Linking a design system means you never get generic direction cards: exploring variants without real HTML is now refused for that design rather than rendering placeholder screens that ignore your tokens.
- Your design system, original prompt, and reference screenshots now reach the turn that actually generates the design, instead of being spent on the questions step.

## 2026-08-12

### Improved

- Shared designs now keep viewers read-only and let commenters add review comments without editing the design.

## 2026-08-11

### Improved

- Design sharing now identifies viewers who can add review comments
- New designs now skip the intake questions and follow your existing work when Creative Context already holds closely related pieces.

### Fixed

- Chrome no longer offers to install Design as a desktop app.
- Design agent prompts copy successfully in the desktop app.

## 2026-08-10

### Improved

- The frame tool draws a plain frame by default, with Screen available in its dropdown

### Fixed

## 2026-08-07

### Improved

- Design cards now show who created each design, with a filter by creator when your workspace has more than one person.
- Hold Option/Alt while dragging a frame on the overview canvas to drop a copy of it, including a whole multi-frame selection.

### Fixed

- Alt-dragging an element to copy it now keeps the copy visible on the canvas instead of only adding it to the layer list.
- Cmd+C now copies selected text in the agent panel instead of being captured by the canvas copy shortcut
- Drawing a shape on the overview canvas now keeps the shape selected instead of its screen, so duplicating copies the shape rather than the whole screen.
- Real-time voice can now read the current selection and edit the design, instead of failing to verify the agent thread

## 2026-08-05

### Improved

- Renaming a layer now focuses its name field automatically.
- Website URL imports now capture hydrated browser-computed design systems for more faithful reuse.

### Fixed

- Chat attachments now warn before upload when they exceed the 4 MB total limit, instead of failing with an unexplained error.

- Missing design systems now return a clear not-found response.

## 2026-08-03

### Improved

- Arrow keys now reorder a layer inside an auto layout or grid frame the way Figma does, and nudge free-placed layers by an amount you can set in the Cursor tab of the keyboard shortcuts panel.
- Auto layout flow icons show the direction at a glance instead of needing a hover.
- Auto layout icons share one outlined-square style, so flow, gap and padding read as one set.
- Export has a named Preview section you can expand, replacing the unlabeled image icon.
- Inspector sections show an expand indicator, so it is clear which ones open.
- Pasting with a frame selected now places the copy inside that frame, joining its auto layout when it has one, while pasting with an object selected still places the copy beside it.
- The add-breakpoint button sits outside the breakpoint selector, so it no longer looks like a breakpoint you can pick.
- The agent's follow-up questions share the chat panel's background, so they read as part of the conversation.
- The text tool uses a T icon, matching the letter it inserts.

### Fixed

- Design token indexing now skips malformed saved token values instead of crashing
- Export preview shows the selected element instead of the whole screen, with its real pixel size.
- Stale design links now return a not-found response instead of a server error

## 2026-07-30

### Improved

- Design HTML is now validated with a spec-grade HTML parser instead of hand-rolled scanning, so markup inside attributes and scripts is no longer mistaken for real tags.
- Designs now load their Tailwind and Alpine runtimes from the app itself instead of a public CDN, so an ad blocker, a restricted network, or being offline cannot leave every screen unstyled.

### Fixed

- A broken inline script in a generated screen is now caught on save instead of silently never running.
- Designs with a broken Alpine expression are now caught on save instead of rendering with every interaction silently dead.
- Editing a design no longer strips its styling: the canvas now keeps the page's compiled CSS instead of discarding it on every update.
- Fixed the keyboard shortcuts panel not opening with Ctrl+Shift+? on macOS, inside the canvas, or during agent question flows

## 2026-07-29

### Added

- Copy rendered UI between live local apps and Design files while preserving source locations and styles.
- A selected frame's size is now editable, with a device-preset picker on the Size section, so an existing frame can be set to a phone, tablet, or desktop size.

### Improved

- An edit that cannot be written to source now names the reason — repeated instances, a client-rendered screen whose served HTML has no app markup, or source that has not finished loading — instead of reporting the selected element as missing.
- Auto-layout direction buttons now show a direction arrow, so the flow direction is readable without hovering for the tooltip.
- Selecting layers and adding frames are faster: the layer projection is reused for unchanged screens and creating a frame no longer refetches every screen's contents.
- Canvas zoom now steps about 10% per mouse notch like Figma instead of nearly tripling, and frame labels hold a constant size throughout the gesture instead of scaling and snapping back.
- Added Figma-parity shortcuts: A also picks the frame tool, Shift+Cmd+G ungroups, and Shift+0 resets zoom to 100%.
- Localhost source errors now say what actually went wrong — which connection, which workspace, or that the bridge needs reconnecting — instead of a generic failure.
- The breakpoint + menu keeps offering device widths after the default Desktop, Tablet, and Phone breakpoints are added, instead of falling back to a bare number input.
- Sidebar footers now keep Feedback, Search, and Collapse together without a separate language shortcut.
- The Code panel and Apply design update control now use clearer, more compact editor chrome.
- The Tools panel now keeps extension creation and discovery hidden unless explicitly enabled.
- Visual edits on a mapped component instance now tell the agent where that instance was rendered from, not just which React key it had.

### Fixed

- Applying a primitive dropped onto a connected localhost screen no longer fails with an anchors-still-loading error.
- Adding a breakpoint now re-packs the board when the new frames would overlap a neighbouring screen, and the add control says it applies to all screens.
- Changing a style in the inspector now updates a connected local app immediately and queues the edit for Apply design updates
- Choosing Edit or Annotate from a focused screen now returns to the infinite canvas instead of leaving the screen stranded, and Interact hides the canvas toolbar it does not own.
- Concurrent source edits now return a clear conflict response instead of an internal error.
- Creating a component from an element that repeats in the source now names the conflicting match count instead of annotating whichever instance came first.
- Deleting an element you just dropped onto a live screen no longer leaves it queued to be re-added when changes are applied to source.
- Design boards stay dark and viewport-height content keeps its intended device size.
- Design frames no longer grow continuously when their content uses viewport-relative height.
- Double-clicking a frame now selects the layer under the pointer so its styling options open, instead of switching the editor into Interact.
- Dragging a layer across screens no longer dies when the pointer crosses into a live localhost screen, and drops onto plain block-layout pages now resolve a target instead of silently failing
- Dragging an element from a stored screen into a live localhost screen is now handed to the coding agent as a move instead of being silently copied in as new markup.
- Drawing a box on the canvas and dragging it into a connected localhost screen now inserts it into the running app, with undo, redo, and Apply.
- The inspector's export preview now shows the actual rendered output instead of a plain coloured rectangle, and says so when it cannot render.
- Fixed a loading-screen flicker when reopening designs with an in-progress generation.
- Interact mode has Edit and Annotate buttons again, so you can leave a responsive preview straight into either canvas mode.
- Layer groups can be dropped onto live localhost screens without corrupting the screen URL.
- Opening or refreshing a live localhost screen in single-screen view no longer blanks the running app and its layer list.
- Redo after undoing a drop onto a live screen puts the element back instead of silently doing nothing.
- Shapes can now be drawn directly onto live localhost screens while keeping the screen connected to the running app.
- Shapes drawn on the canvas board now appear immediately instead of only after a page reload, so you can draw one and drag it straight into a screen.
- Style edits on a running localhost screen now preview live and queue for the agent with their React source anchor, instead of silently disappearing when the element's runtime id goes stale.
- The text tool now reaches the board's own editing surface, so a text box you draw on the canvas can be typed into immediately, and boxes left empty are cleaned up instead of lingering invisibly.
- The Apply design updates control now appears as a clean, connected split button

## 2026-07-28

### Added

- Interact mode now shows a responsive device preview with presets, editable width/height, and zoom-to-fit, alongside the usual panels

### Improved

- Design edits can be applied through the host coding agent from an inline MCP canvas
- Figma .fig uploads now show indexing progress and an Open in Builder link to the generated project once decoding finishes.
- Layer hide and lock now apply to the live preview instead of only the layers list

- Show or hide Design editing chrome from Cmd+K, the canvas menu, or Figma's Shift+\ shortcut.
- Visual edit on a local dev server no longer requires signing in

### Fixed

- Deleting a selected element now removes it from the live preview
- Deleting an element on a connected localhost screen now queues a pending live edit, so the deletion reaches app source and Cmd+Z takes it back.
- Generated design variants no longer overlap each other on the overview board, and zooming or panning a board with breakpoint frames no longer flashes screen content
- Generated designs with malformed HTML are now rejected at save with the exact line and character to fix, instead of persisting and rendering broken.
- Layers-panel selections on a connected localhost screen can now be deleted with Delete or Backspace.
- Apply design update now includes pending live text and structure edits, so deletions are applied with the rest of the session changes
- The design canvas no longer stalls on a render loop while a design is loading
- The model you pick when starting a new design is now used for the design's first generation turn instead of falling back to the default model.
- Visual edit now always shows the live running app in the canvas instead of a frozen HTML snapshot
- Visual edits on a React 19 app no longer report a source line that is really the dev server's transformed line — anchors now say whether a position is authored or transformed, and the deterministic writer refuses a transformed one instead of editing the wrong element.

- Design owners can keep editing their designs after switching workspaces
- Figma line/arrow vectors and stroked icons now render instead of vanishing — fixed clipping of strokes and zero-size line vectors.

## 2026-07-16

### Added

- The Agent workspace now includes a Library for reusing verified creative context, including version-pinned Figma designs cloned as editable HTML/CSS without regeneration.
