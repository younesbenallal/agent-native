/**
 * Regression guard for the design template's DB-reliability rollout (mirrors
 * templates/analytics/server/plugins/db.spec.ts): `design_fusion_edits` was
 * declared in server/db/schema.ts but never had a matching migration in
 * db.ts, so a fresh/existing database was missing the table entirely and any
 * write to it 500'd. Live audit against the template's Neon database
 * confirmed the table did not exist even though the recorded migrations
 * table had already advanced past every other version — the table-creation
 * counterpart to the analytics v75-v83 version-collision incident.
 *
 * This walks every Drizzle table exported from schema.ts and asserts every
 * declared SQL column name appears somewhere in the migrations source
 * (db.ts) — either in the table's original `CREATE TABLE` or in a later
 * `ADD COLUMN` migration. It can't prove *ordering* (a column could still be
 * referenced only in a comment), but it catches the exact failure mode here:
 * a schema column with zero mentions in the migration history.

 * db.ts source (matching the exact object-literal shape this file uses:
 * `version:` immediately followed, a few lines later, by an optional
 * `name: "..."`) and asserts:
 *
 *   (a) every declared `name` is unique across the whole list, and
 *   (b) every entry whose version is > 18 (design's current max version as
 *       of this rollout) has a `name`.
 *
 * We deliberately do NOT require every legacy entry (v1-v18) to have a name —
 * naming ALL of them would make every one of those migrations re-apply by
 * name on every existing database, which is only safe if every single one of
 * those older SQL statements is idempotent. That has not been verified here,
 * so only new entries added after this rollout (v19+) are required to carry
 * a name.
