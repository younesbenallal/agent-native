  How to view, export, and analyze form responses. Use when the user asks
  about submitted data, wants to export responses, or needs response analytics.

# Form Responses

## Viewing Responses

Use `list-responses` to see submissions for a specific form:

```bash
pnpm action list-responses --form <form-id> [--limit 50]
```

This shows each response with field labels and values, ordered by submission date (newest first).

For chart/table analytics, prefer `response-insights`:

```bash
# All recent accessible forms
pnpm action response-insights

# One form
pnpm action response-insights --formId <form-id> --days 30 --limit 300
```

`response-insights` returns an explicit first-party widget payload:

- `widget: "data-insights"`
- `chartSeries` for submissions by day
- `table` for recent response rows
- `summary` with total, sampled, and truncation details

Native chat renderers should use that contract for first-party tables/charts.
MCP Apps/iframe rendering is only a fallback for external hosts.

For form setup/configuration previews, use `preview-form`:

```bash
pnpm action preview-form --formId <form-id>
```

It returns a native inline summary/table with the form fields, response count,
status, visibility, and an "Open editor" action.

## Exporting Responses

Use `export-responses` to export to CSV or JSON. The export is uploaded to
configured file storage (never written to local disk — serverless hosts have
a read-only filesystem) and the action returns the resulting file URL:

```bash
# CSV export (default)
pnpm action export-responses --form <form-id>

# JSON export
pnpm action export-responses --form <form-id> --format json
```

The CSV includes headers derived from field labels. Array values (multiselect) are joined with semicolons.

## Response Data Structure

Each response is stored in the `responses` SQL table:

| Column           | Type | Description                          |
| ---------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------ |
| `id`             | text | Unique response ID                   |
| `formId`         | text | Foreign key to the form              |
| `data`           | text | JSON string of field ID -> value map |
| `submittedAt`    | text | ISO timestamp                        |
| `ip`             | text | Submitter IP when available          |
| `submitterEmail` | text | Submitter email hint when known      |
| `pageUrl`        | text | Page the respondent was on, if sent  |
| `clientSurface`  | text | App surface: web, electron, or tauri |

`submitterEmail` may come from the logged-in Forms session or from trusted
feedback clients that pass the logged-in user email as submission metadata.

`pageUrl` and `clientSurface` are hidden pass-through fields. Direct public
fills record the current form URL, while trusted embeds (e.g. the framework
FeedbackButton) forward the respondent's source page and runtime shell (`web`,
`electron`, or `tauri`) so owners can see which screen and app feedback came
from. Sensitive URL query keys are scrubbed before persistence, `clientSurface`
is allowlisted server-side (unknown values are dropped), and anonymous forms
suppress both fields. The responses table surfaces them as "Page" and "Source"
columns when any response carries them.

The `data` JSON maps field IDs to values:

```json
{
  "name": "Alice Smith",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "rating": 5,
  "interests": ["design", "development"]
}
```

## Analyzing Responses

To analyze responses, the workflow is:

1. `list-forms` to find the form ID
2. `preview-form --formId <id>` when the question is about setup or fields
3. `response-insights --formId <id>` for counts, daily submissions, and table data
4. Use `list-responses --formId <id>` only when exact row-level inspection is needed
5. Report whether the answer is exact or sampled, including row counts and truncation

For an actionable theme, ground one concise title and evidence line in the
`response-insights` result, then call `show-response-insight` with a specific
follow-up prompt. Its button only prefills the Forms chat; it does not submit or
change the form.

## Common Tasks

| User request           | What to do                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "@Form setup?"         | `preview-form --formId <id>` and answer from the returned fields/settings    |
| "How many responses?"  | `response-insights --formId <id>` and report `summary.responses`             |
| "Export to CSV"        | `export-responses --form <id>`                                               |
| "Submissions by day"   | `response-insights --formId <id> --days 30`                                  |
| "Summarize feedback"   | `response-insights`, then `list-responses` if more detail is needed          |
| "Average rating"       | `list-responses`, compute from rating fields and state the sampled row count |
| "Who submitted today?" | `list-responses`, filter by submittedAt                                      |
