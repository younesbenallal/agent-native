Fixed decks with many slides loading slowly and rendering incorrectly in the editor. Every slide thumbnail measured its full layout on mount, so a long deck forced hundreds of page reflows at once; off-screen thumbnails now wait until they scroll into view, and the browser skips painting them entirely until then. The hover buttons on each thumbnail also no longer blur what is behind them, which was making the rail flicker and leaving dark patches over the editor.
