 * every read/write touching a pre-existing production table, because
 * `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` is a no-op once the table already exists.
 *
 * This walks every Drizzle table exported from schema.ts and asserts every

 * Extracts every `{ version: N, ... }` migration entry from the raw db.ts
 * source (matching the exact object-literal shape this file uses: `version:`
 * immediately followed, a few lines later, by an optional `name: "..."`) and
 * asserts:
 *
 *   (a) every declared `name` is unique across the whole list, and
 *   (b) every entry whose version is > 19 (slides' current max version) has

 *
 * We deliberately do NOT require every legacy entry (v1-v19) to have a name —
 * naming ALL of them would make every one of those migrations re-apply by
 * name on every existing database, which is only safe if every single one of
 * those older SQL statements is idempotent (v10-v15 are NOT — they're
 * Postgres-only `ALTER COLUMN ... TYPE` casts that fail if re-run against an
 * already-converted column). Only new migrations added after v19 must be
 * named.
