  Tiers, checkpoints, and off-limits paths for an agent editing the app's own
  source. Use when designing UI for agent editability, deciding whether a file
  is safe for the agent to change, or when tempted to patch config, `.env`, or
  an `@agent-native/*` package. Do not load it for ordinary source edits.

# Self-Modifying Code

## Rule

The agent can edit the app's own source code — components, routes, styles, scripts. This is a feature, not a bug. Design your app expecting this.

## Why

An agent-native app isn't just an app the agent can _use_ — it's an app the agent can _change_. The agent can fix bugs, add features, adjust styles, and restructure code. This makes the agent a true collaborator, not just an operator.

## Modification Taxonomy

Not all modifications are equal. Use this to decide what level of care is needed:

| Tier          | What                  | Examples                                         | After modifying                   |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| 1: Data       | Files in `data/`      | JSON state, generated content, markdown          | Nothing — these are routine       |
| 2: Source     | App code              | Components, routes, styles, scripts              | Run `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint` |
| 3: Config     | Project config        | `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.*` | Ask for explicit approval first   |
| 4: Off limits | Secrets and framework | `.env`, `@agent-native/*` packages & overrides   | Never modify these                |

Tier 4 includes **all** of the following — not only editing package source:

- Files under `node_modules/@agent-native/*` (core, dispatch, scheduling, …)
- `pnpm.overrides`, `overrides`, `resolutions`, or `patchedDependencies` that
  target any `@agent-native/*` package
- `pnpm patch`, `pnpm patch-commit`, or local package patch artifacts for any
  dependency
- Invented "dispatch/core behavior" shims meant to paper over a version skew
  or failed upgrade

This does not prohibit intentional app-owned UI customization. When public
props and composition are insufficient, the `customizing-agent-native` skill
uses `agent-native eject` to transfer the smallest supported unit from the
installed package into the app. The ejected unit must keep public runtime
contracts and must not replace Core auth, DB, actions, agent execution, or
transport behavior. Manual copying is only the fallback described by an unknown
third-party package's add-style blueprint.

When an older branch needs current packages, use **`agent-native upgrade`**
(see the `upgrade-agent-native` skill). If upgrade or typecheck fails, fix
**app** code or stop and ask — do not patch the framework.

## Git Checkpoint Pattern

Before modifying source code (Tier 2+), create a rollback point:

1. Commit or stash current state
2. Make the edit
3. Run `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint`
4. If verification fails → revert with `git checkout -- <file>`
5. If verification passes → continue

This ensures the agent can experiment without breaking the app.

## Designing for Agent Editability

Make your app easy for the agent to understand and modify:

**Expose UI state via `data-*` attributes** so the agent knows what's selected:

```ts
const el = document.documentElement;
el.dataset.currentView = view;
el.dataset.selectedId = selectedItem?.id || "";
```

**Expose richer context via `window.__appState`** for complex state:

```ts
(window as any).__appState = {
  selectedId: id,
  currentLayout: layout,
  itemCount: items.length,
};
```

**Use configuration-driven rendering** — Extract visual decisions (colors, layouts, sizes) into JSON config files in `data/`. The agent can modify the config (Tier 1) instead of the component source (Tier 2).

**Keep localized copy in catalogs** — When editing visible UI copy, labels,
toasts, empty states, prompts, or formatting, update the English source catalog.
Read the optional `internationalization` skill and update additional catalogs
only when `translations.locales` in `agent-native.config.ts` includes them.

## Don't

- Don't modify `.env` files or files containing secrets
- Don't modify `@agent-native/core`, `@agent-native/dispatch`, or other
  `@agent-native/*` package internals (including under `node_modules`)
- Don't confuse readable package source with app-owned code: use
  `customizing-agent-native` and `agent-native eject` for supported ownership
  transfer
- Don't use `pnpm patch` / `pnpm patch-commit`, commit `patches/` artifacts, or
  add `pnpm.patchedDependencies` to "make the app run" after a version bump
- Don't add `pnpm.overrides` / `patchedDependencies` / `resolutions` for
  `@agent-native/*` to paper over a broken upgrade
- Don't invent local dispatch/core behavior overrides when upgrade fails —
  run `npx @agent-native/core@latest upgrade`, then fix app-level errors only
- Don't modify `.agents/skills/` or `AGENTS.md` unless explicitly requested
- Don't skip the typecheck/lint step after editing source code
- Don't make source changes without a git checkpoint to roll back to
