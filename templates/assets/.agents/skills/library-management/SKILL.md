# Library management

Use this skill before adding fields, changing access checks, or modifying delete behavior.

## User surface

The human Library workspace is canonical at `/library`. The root selects
"All assets" and browses assets across every accessible brand kit; `/library/:id`
opens one kit's management detail. Legacy `/brand-kits` URLs redirect here.
Embedded picker hosts still load `/library` in an iframe and keep the existing
bridge contract.

## Schema overview

```
image_libraries           — top-level library, has ownableColumns + shares
  ├─ custom_instructions  — durable free-text prompt guidance
  └─ image_collections    — optional sub-grouping (categories), inherits access
  └─ image_assets         — every image (refs + generated), inherits access
  └─ image_generation_runs — one per generate call, inherits access
```

`image_assets` and `image_collections` and `image_generation_runs` do **NOT** carry `ownableColumns` themselves. They inherit access from their parent `library_id` via `assertAccess("asset-library", libraryId, ...)`.

## Access control

Every action that touches an ownable resource must scope its queries:

- **List queries**: `accessFilter(schema.assetLibraries, schema.assetLibraryShares)` in WHERE.
  Cross-kit asset lists must first resolve the accessible library IDs, then
  query `image_assets` by those IDs and include the parent kit title for UI chips.
- **Read by id**: `await resolveAccess("asset-library", libraryId)`. The `requireLibrary(id)` helper in `_helpers.ts` wraps this.
- **Write**: never `assertAccess(..., "editor")` directly. Use `server/lib/library-access.ts`, which splits writing into drafting and approving (below); `"admin"` still guards library archive / delete.

All assets / runs derive `libraryId` first, then assert against the parent library. Never query `image_assets` without also pinning `library_id` to a value the caller has access to.

### Drafting vs approving

A kit `viewer` may **draft**: generation runs, generation sessions, and `image_assets` rows with `role: "generated"` and `status: "candidate"`. Drafts never reach the kit's content — `shouldIncludeAssetInLibraryResults` filters unsaved candidates out of every library read — so a read-only collaborator can safely make them.

`editor` is still required to **approve**: promoting a candidate to `saved`, uploads, imports, folders, collections, style brief, canonical logo, templates, and deletes.

| Helper | Bar | Use for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `assertCanDraft(libraryId)` | viewer | generate / refine / rerun, sessions, variant slots |
| `assertCanApprove(libraryId, what)` | editor | save, upload, import, organize, kit settings |
| `assertCanDraftAuthoredBy(libraryId, author, what)` | viewer for own | a session or run someone else may have created |
| `assertCanDeleteAsset(asset)` | viewer for own draft | discarding a candidate vs deleting kit content |

Drafting in a kit is not a licence to touch another drafter's work, so the
author-scoped rule guards every write that lands on an existing row someone else
made:

- `requireGenerationSessionInLibrary` scopes the session a generation attaches
  to. Belonging to the kit is not enough — appending a candidate also moves the
  session's `activeAssetId`. Pass the access you already resolved to skip the
  second lookup.
- `refresh-generation-run` reconciles a run row (status, error, outputs) and
  `rerun-generation-run` reuses its prompt, settings, and session, so both stay
  with the run's `ownerEmail`.
- Draft *reads* narrow the same way. `resolveDraftReadScope` +
  `canReadDraftAsset` / `canReadRun` keep candidates and run history to their
  author plus anyone who could approve them, across `get-library`,
  `list-assets`, `search-assets`, and `list-draft-assets`. The lookup only runs
  when a read actually returns candidates, so ordinary asset lists cost nothing.
  Content fetched by explicit id (`/api/assets/:id/content`, `get-asset`) stays
  gated on kit read access only, because cross-app embeds of a fresh candidate
  depend on it.
- Draft *inputs* answer to the read rule too. `assertCanUseAssets` /
  `assertCanUseRuns` guard every path that takes an asset or run id —
  generation references, lineage source, subject, video source, and session
  attachments — because a scope that holds on list surfaces but not on id
  arguments is not a boundary. `selectReferences` takes a required `draftScope`
  so a new generation path cannot forget it: the automatic pool scores every
  asset in the kit, candidates included.
- Sessions and run history narrow the same way. `sessionReadFilter` /
  `canReadSession` keep `list-generation-sessions` and `get-generation-session`
  to the sessions a below-approver caller created (and strip items, candidates,
  and runs they cannot read), and `runReadFilter` / `canReadRun` do the same for
  `list-generation-runs` and `get-generation-run`. Reading one by id is not a
  way around the list rule.
- Deleting a draft goes through `deleteDraftAssetIfUnchanged`, never a bare
  delete-by-id. Authorization comes from a prior read, so the predicate lets an
  editor's concurrent approval win, and the confirming re-read keeps the answer
  portable. `delete-asset` reports the refusal; `dismiss-variant-slots` counts
  it in `assetsRetained`.
- Paging happens after the filter, not before. `draftReadFilter` turns the scope
  into a WHERE clause for `list-draft-assets`; filtering post-`limit` silently
  drops the caller's own older drafts behind other people's newer ones.
- `dismiss-variant-slots` re-reads every asset behind the slots it clears.
  Variant state is client-writable, so a slot id is never permission to delete:
  anything outside the state's kit, already saved, or authored by someone else
  clears from the tray and comes back in `assetsRetained`. The delete itself is
  conditional on the state that was authorized, so an editor's save always beats
  an in-flight dismissal, and the outcome is confirmed by re-reading rather than
  by a confirming Postgres read.

`assertCanDraft` returns `{ role, canApprove }`. Generation actions report `draftPendingApproval: true` when `canApprove` is false so the caller can say the images are waiting on an editor instead of claiming they were saved. `get-library-access` exposes the same answer to the UI and to other agents.

The refusal message keeps the framework's `Requires editor role on asset-library <id> (have viewer)` prefix on purpose: core's permanent-precondition classifier matches that shape and ends the agent turn instead of retrying a grant it cannot obtain. Keep it if you reword the remedy.

## Adding a new field

The schema is **strictly additive**. Hosted templates share their prod DB across every deploy context, so destructive changes wipe live user data. Rules:

- Add a column via `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS ...` in `server/plugins/db.ts` with a new migration version.
- Never rename or drop. If a column is wrong, add the replacement alongside it.
- Never use `drizzle-kit push` against production. The framework guard will fail the build.

Example: adding `image_libraries.icon`:

1. Bump the migration version array in `server/plugins/db.ts`:
   ```ts
   {
     version: 6,
     sql: `ALTER TABLE image_libraries ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS icon TEXT`,
   },
   ```
2. Add `icon: text("icon")` to `schema.ts` for `image_libraries`.
3. Read it in actions. Done.

## Sharing

Libraries follow the standard framework sharing model:

- `visibility: "private" | "org" | "public"`
- Per-user / per-org grants in `image_library_shares` with `viewer | editor | admin` roles.
- Use the framework actions `share-resource`, `unshare-resource`, `set-resource-visibility` with `--resourceType=asset-library`. The legacy `image-library` alias remains registered for existing grants.

Generated assets and references inherit the parent library's visibility. v1 doesn't support per-asset overrides; the schema is forward-compatible (`image_generated_image_shares` could be added without disturbing existing rows) but not surfaced in the UI.

## Duplicating a brand kit

Use `duplicate-library` when a user wants a Brand Kit copy. The action creates a
private, current-user-owned copy with durable kit contents remapped, without
copying shares, visibility, generation runs, or handoff sessions.

## Cascade delete

`delete-library` deletes in order:

1. `image_assets WHERE library_id = $1`
2. `image_generation_runs WHERE library_id = $1`
3. `image_collections WHERE library_id = $1`
4. `image_library_shares WHERE resource_id = $1`
5. `image_libraries WHERE id = $1`

The asset rows are deleted from SQL but the underlying objects in S3 / local fallback are **not** automatically reaped — that's a v2 background job. For now, the orphaned blobs are tolerable since the framework's asset URLs all check access via the asset row.

## Reference vs. generated

Reference images and generated images live in the **same** `image_assets` table, distinguished by:

- `role` — what kind of evidence: `style_reference` / `logo_reference` / `product_reference` / `diagram_reference` / `generated`
- `status` — what to do with it: `reference` (uploaded by user) / `candidate` (just generated, ephemeral) / `saved` (user kept it) / `archived` (hidden) / `failed` (errored)

The unified table simplifies access control (one `library_id`, one access check) and makes "use a saved generation as a reference for a future generation" a first-class operation — just bump its `role` to `prior-candidate` (planned for v2; v1 just selects from any non-archived asset).

## Importing external references

Ingest external brand or blog imagery with `import-asset-from-url`, then pin the
returned asset to preset reference boards or set it as the canonical logo.

Use `import-asset-from-url` when the agent has found a public HTTPS image that
belongs in a brand kit, such as a blog hero, product shot, logo, campaign image,
or diagram. Choose the narrowest reference `role` (`style_reference`,
`subject_reference`, `product_reference`, `background_reference`,
`logo_reference`, or `diagram_reference`) and preserve a useful title or
description when known. The deliverable `category` defaults to match the role
(logo → `logo`, product → `product`, diagram → `diagram`); pass an explicit
`category` such as `hero` or `campaign` when the image belongs in one of those
filtered views.

For a blog-to-brand-kit workflow: inspect the page, pick the strongest image
URLs, import each URL into the target `libraryId`, then wire the returned
`assetId`s into associated Template reference fills or call `set-canonical-logo`
for the exact logo. Imported assets are stored as `status: "reference"` with
`sourceUrl` provenance, so downstream generation, preset boards, and logo
compositing can use them like uploaded reference assets.

## Importing a rendered visual system

Use `import-style-from-url` when a public website should contribute more than
images to a library or collection. It uses the same layered browser extractor
as Design and Slides, so CSS-in-JS, Tailwind, hydration, web fonts, computed
colors, component styles, spacing, radii, shadows, CSS variables, and logo
references are captured from the live cascade. The action persists a bounded
`designMd` summary plus structured fields in `styleBrief`, with the source URL
and any browser/static-fallback warnings preserved for provenance.

Prefer this action over copying raw HTML into a style brief. If the result is
`partial`, the structured values are still usable but the warnings must remain
visible to the agent; `failed` is an error and must not be treated as an empty
style brief.

## When to add a collection

Collections are optional. Most users won't create them. Use them when:

- A library has multiple distinct visual systems (e.g. "blog heroes" vs "landing imagery" within one brand library).
- The user wants per-collection defaults (aspect ratio, image size, style brief layered on top of the library's).

Skip them otherwise. A flat library with category-tagged assets covers most cases.
