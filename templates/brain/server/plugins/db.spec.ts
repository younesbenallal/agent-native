/**
 * Guard for the name-based migration tracking convention (see the
 * `runMigrations` doc comment in packages/core/src/db/migrations.ts for the
 * full rationale — the fix for the shared-DB version-collision incident where
 * two branches independently extend the same migration list under the same
 * version numbers).
 *
 * A live read-only audit against the shared Neon database (2026-07-02) found
 * exactly this collision here: a parallel branch recorded v21/v22 in
 * `brain_migrations` for its own `brain_ask_history` tables before this
 * template's v20 (11 performance indexes) ever ran, so the legacy
 * `version > MAX(recorded version)` gate treated v20 as already applied even
 * though none of its indexes existed. v20 was repaired with a `name:` slug
 * (`"brain-ownable-perf-indexes"`) so it re-applies by name on any database
 * regardless of recorded MAX(version). See the comment on v20 in db.ts.
 *
 * Extracts every `{ version: N, ... }` migration entry from the raw db.ts
 * source (matching the exact object-literal shape this file uses: `version:`
 * immediately followed, a few lines later, by an optional `name: "..."`) and
 * asserts:
 *
 *   (a) every declared `name` is unique across the whole list, and
 *   (b) every entry whose version is > 20 (brain's own pre-existing max
 *       version before the naming convention was introduced) has a `name`.
 *
 * We deliberately do NOT require every legacy entry (v1-v20, aside from the
 * repaired v20) to have a name — naming ALL of them would make every one of
 * those migrations re-apply by name on every existing database, which is
 * only safe if every single one of those older SQL statements is idempotent.
 * That has not been verified here, so only entries from v21 onward (going
 * forward) are required to be named, plus v20 itself (confirmed idempotent
 * and confirmed swallowed by the live audit above).
